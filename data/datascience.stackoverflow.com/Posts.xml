Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are &quot;fixed&quot; and which are flexible. For example, the model may allow you to define your own network structure (or even learn it) with certain constraints. You have to decide whether this flexibility is sufficient for your purposes. Then within a particular network structure, you can learn parameters given a specific training dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You rarely hard-code behavior in AI/ML solutions. It's all about modelling the underlying situation and accommodating different situations by tweaking elements of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your example, perhaps you might have the robot learn how to detect obstacles (by analyzing elements in the environment), or you might have it keep track of where the obstacles were and which way they were moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="51" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T00:36:31.077" CommentCount="0" />

Generally, though, I'd say you're certainly dealing with big data if the scale is such that it's no longer feasible to manage with more traditional technologies such as RDBMS, at least without complementing them with big data technologies such as Hadoop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How big your data has to actually be for that to be the case is debatable.  Here's a (somewhat provocative) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that claims that it's not really the case for less than 5 TB of data.  (To be clear, it doesn't claim &quot;Less than 5 TB isn't big data&quot;, but just &quot;Less than 5 TB isn't big enough that you need Hadoop&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even on smaller datasets, big data technologies like Hadoop can have other advantages, including being well suited to batch operations, playing well with unstructured data (as well as data whose structure isn't known in advance or could change), horizontal scalability (scaling by adding more nodes instead of beefing up your existing servers), and (as one of the commenters on the above-linked post notes) the ability to integrate your data processing with external data sets (think of a map-reduce where the mapper makes a call to another server).  Other technologies associated with big data, like NoSql databases, emphasize fast performance and consistent availability while dealing with large sets of data, as well also being able to handle semi-unstructured data and to scale horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, traditional RDBMS have their own advantages including ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and better performance for certain operations, as well as being more standardized, more mature, and (for many users) more familiar.  So even for indisputably &quot;big&quot; data, it may make sense to load at least a portion of your data into a traditional SQL database and use that in conjunction with big data technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, a more generous definition would be that you have big data so long as it's big enough that big data technologies provide some added value for you.  But as you can see, that can depend not just on the size of your data but on how you want to work with it and what sort of requirements you have in terms of flexibility, consistency, and performance.  &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; you're using your data is more relevant to the question than what you're using it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. data mining).  That said, uses like data mining and machine learning are more likely to yield useful results if you have a big enough data set to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T05:44:29.340" CommentCount="0" />

The first part, let us call it &lt;em&gt;soft preprocessing&lt;/em&gt;, could be taken as the usage of different data mining algorithms to preprocess data in such a way that makes it suitable for further analyses. Notice that this could be the analysis itself, in case the goal is simple enough to be tackled in a single shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part, the &lt;em&gt;hard preprocessing&lt;/em&gt;, actually comes prior to any other process, and is may be taken as the usage of simple tools or scripts to clean up data, selecting specific contents to be processed. To this problem, POSIX provides us with a wonderous set of magic tools, which can be used to compose concise -- and very powerful -- preprocessing scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, for people who deal with data coming from social websites (twitter, facebook, ...), the &lt;em&gt;data retrieval&lt;/em&gt; usually yields files with very specific format -- although not always nicely structure, as they may contain missing fields, and so. For these cases, a simple &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; script could clean up the data, producing a &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; input file for later processing. From the magic set, one may also point out &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, and a whole multitude of other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In case simple the source file has too many nitty-gritties, it may also be necessary to produce a bundle of methods to clean up data. In such cases, it is usually better to use scripting languages (other than shell ones), such as Python, Ruby, and Perl. This allows for building up &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;'s to select specific data in a very straightforward and reusable way. Such &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt;'s are sometimes made public by their writers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;IMDbPY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.stackexchange.com/docs&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange API&lt;/a&gt;, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, answering the question: are there any best practices? It usually depends on your task. If you will always deal with the same data format, it's commonly best to write an &lt;em&gt;organized&lt;/em&gt; script to preprocess it; whereas, if you just need a simple and fast clean up on some dataset, count on POSIX tools for concise shell scripts that will do the whole job &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; faster than a Python script, or so. Since the &lt;em&gt;clean up&lt;/em&gt; depends both on the dataset and on your purposes, it's hard to have everything already done. Yet, there are lots of API's that puts you halfway through with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T16:29:39.927" CommentCount="6" />

Suppose you have a data set which you split in two (test and training).  An overfitted model is one that performs much worse on the test dataset than on training dataset.  It is often observed that models like that also in general perform worse on a test dataset than models which are not overfitted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way to understand that intuitively is that a model may use some relevant parts of the data (signal) and some irrelevant parts (noise).  An overfitted model uses more of the noise, which increases its performance in the case of known noise (training data) and decreases its performance in the case of novel noise (test data).  The difference in performance between training and test data indicates how much noise the model picks up; and picking up noise directly translates into worse performance on test data (including future data).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary: overfitting is bad by definition, this has not much to do with either complexity or ability to generalize, but rather has to do with mistaking noise for signal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. On the &quot;ability to generalize&quot; part of the question, it is very possible to have a model which has inherently limited ability to generalize due to the structure of the model (for example linear SVM, ...) but is still prone to overfitting.

The scientists have given you information collected from their work &#xA;with such plants throughout a whole year, and they shall continuously give you information on the future development of their plantation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you run through the data received, and build up a model out of it. Now suppose that, in your model, you considered just as many characteristics as possible to always find out the exact behavior of the plants you saw in the initial dataset. Now, as the production continues, you'll always take into account those characteristics, and will produce very &lt;em&gt;fine-grained&lt;/em&gt; results. However, if the plantation eventually suffer from some seasonal change, the results you will receive may fit your model in such a way that your predictions will begin to fail (either saying that the growth will slow down, while it shall actually speed up, or the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from being unable to detect such small variations, and to usually classify your entries incorrectly, the &lt;em&gt;fine-grain&lt;/em&gt; on the model, i.e., the great amount of variables, may cause the processing to be too costly. Now, imagine that your data is already complex.

Querying, or&#xA;  traversing, the graph involves following paths. Because of the&#xA;  fundamentally path-oriented nature of the datamodel, the majority of&#xA;  path-based graph database operations are highly aligned with the way&#xA;  in which the data is laid out, making them extremely efficient. In&#xA;  their book Neo4j in Action, Partner and Vukotic perform an experiment&#xA;  using a relational store and Neo4j.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The comparison shows that the graph database is substantially quicker&#xA;  for connected data than a relational store.Partner and Vukotic’s&#xA;  experiment seeks to find friends-of-friends in a social network, to a&#xA;  maximum depth of five. Given any two persons chosen at random, is&#xA;  there a path that connects them which is at most five relationships&#xA;  long? For a social network containing 1,000,000 people, each with&#xA;  approximately 50 friends, the results strongly suggest that graph&#xA;  databases are the best choice for connected data, as we see in Table&#xA;  2-1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Table 2-1.

While the Neo4j query runs in two-thirds the time of the relational one, an end-user would barely notice the the difference in milliseconds between the two. By the time we reach depth three (friend-of-friend-of-friend), however, it’s clear that the relational database can no longer deal with the query in a reasonable timeframe: the thirty seconds it takes to complete would be completely unacceptable for an online system. In contrast, Neo4j’s response time remains relatively flat: just a fraction of a second to perform the query—definitely quick enough for an online system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At depth four the relational database exhibits crippling latency,&#xA;  making it practically useless for an online system. Neo4j’s timings&#xA;  have deteriorated a little too, but the latency here is at the&#xA;  periphery of being acceptable for a responsive online system. Finally,&#xA;  at depth five, the relational database simply takes too long to&#xA;  complete the query. Neo4j, in contrast, returns a result in around two&#xA;  seconds. At depth five, it transpires almost the entire network is our&#xA;  friend: for many real-world use cases, we’d likely trim the results,&#xA;  and the timings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions are:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is this a reasonable test to emulate what one might except to find in a social network? &lt;em&gt;(Meaning do real social networks normally have nodes with approximately 50 friends for example; seems like the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_rich_get_richer_%28statistics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rich get richer&lt;/a&gt;&quot; model would be more natural for social networks, though might be wrong.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the naturalness of the emulation, is there any reason to believe the results are off, or unreproducible? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="158" LastEditorUserId="118" LastEditDate="2014-05-15T13:15:02.727" LastActivityDate="2014-05-15T13:15:02.727" Title="Is this Neo4j comparison to RDBMS execution time correct?"

As Christopher said, magnitude of effect a way to treat this.  Combining these two ideas, you might use a confidence interval around your magnitude of effect, and apply a false discovery rate correction to the p-value of the confidence interval.  The effects for which even the lowest bound of the corrected confidence interval is high are likely to be strong effects, regardless of huge data set size.  I am not aware of any published paper that combines confidence intervals with false discovery rate correction in this way, but it seems like a straightforward and intuitively understandable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make this even better, use a non-parametric way to estimate confidence intervals.  Assuming a distribution is likely to give very optimistic estimates here, and even fitting a distribution to the data is likely to be inaccurate.  Since the information about the shape of the distribution past the edges of the confidence interval comes from a relatively small subsample of the data, this is where it really pays to be careful.

There are tons of (hard coded) optimizations, such as locality of reference, compression, caching; all of them usually appliable to different parts of the processing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering that, lets try to address your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;but I imagine it infeasible for the results of every single possible query to be indexed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it would be, and actually is infeasible to have results for &lt;em&gt;every single possible query&lt;/em&gt;. There is an infinite number of terms in the world (even if you assume that only terms properly spelled will be entered), and there is an exponential number of queries from these &lt;code&gt;n -&amp;gt; inf&lt;/code&gt; terms (&lt;code&gt;2^n&lt;/code&gt;). So what is done? Caching. But if there are so many queries/results, which ones to cache? Caching policies. The most frequent/popular/relevant-for-the-user queries are the ones cached.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;wouldn't the hardware latency in Google's hardware be huge? Even if the data in Google were all stored in TB/s SSDs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowdays, with such highly developed processors, people tend to think that every possible task that must finish within a second (or less), and that deals with so much data, must be processed by extremely powerful processors with multiple cores and lots of memory. However, the one thing &lt;em&gt;ruling&lt;/em&gt; market is money, and the investors are not interested in wasting it. So what is done?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The preference is actually for having lots of machines, each using simple/accessible (in terms of cost) processors, which lowers the price of building up the multitude of clusters there are. And yes, it does work. The main bottleneck always boils down to disk, if you consider simple measurements of &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uf6al.gif&quot;&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt;. But once there are so many machines, one can afford to load things up to main memory, instead of working on hard disks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Memory cards are &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; for us, mere human beings, but they are very cheap for enterprises that buy lots of such cards at once. Since it's not costly, having much memory as needed to load indexes and keep caches at hand is not a problem. And since there are so many machines, there is no need for super fast processors, as you can direct queries to different places, and have clusters of machines responsible for attending &lt;em&gt;specific geographical regions&lt;/em&gt;, which allows for more &lt;em&gt;specialized&lt;/em&gt; data caching, and even better response times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does MapReduce help solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I don't think that using or not MapReduce is restricted information inside Google, I'm not conversant about this point. However, Google's implementation of MapReduce (which is surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Hadoop) must have lots of optimizations, many involving the aspects discussed above. So, the architecture of MapReduce probably helps guiding how the computations are physically distributed, but there are many other points to be considered to justify such speed in querying time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Okay, so I understand that popular searches can be cached in memory. But what about unpopular searches?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The graph below presents a curve of how the &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of queries occur. You can see that there are three main kinds of searches, each of them holding approximately 1/3 of the volume of queries (area below curve). The plot shows power law, and reinforces the fact that smaller queries are the most popular. The second third of queries are still feasible to process, since they hold few words. But the set of so-called &lt;em&gt;obscure queries&lt;/em&gt;, which usually consist of non-experienced users' queries, are not a negligible part of the queries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CpcNf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heavy-tailed distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there lies space for novel solutions. Since it's not just one or two queries (but one third of them), they must have &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; results. If you type in something &lt;em&gt;much too obscure&lt;/em&gt; in a Google search, it shan't take longer to return a list of results, but will most probably show you something it &lt;em&gt;inferred&lt;/em&gt; you'd like to say. Or it may simply state that there was no document with such terms -- or even cut down your search to 32 words (which just happened to me in a random test here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of appliable heuristics, which may be either to ignore some words, or to try to break the query into smaller ones, and gather the most &lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt; results. And all these solutions can be tailored and tweaked to respect &lt;em&gt;feasible waiting times&lt;/em&gt; of, say, less then a second? :D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastEditorUserId="84" LastEditDate="2014-05-16T04:33:52.310" LastActivityDate="2014-05-16T04:33:52.310" CommentCount="2" />

Orient is a Graph-Document database server written entirely in Java. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In graph databases, relationships are considered first class citizens and therefore traversing those relationships can be done pretty quickly. Orient is also a document database which would allow you the kind of schema-free architecture it sounds like you would need. The real reason I suggest Orient, however, is because of its extensiblity. It supports streaming via sockets, and the entire database can be embedded into another application. Finally, it can be scaled efficiently and/or can work entirely through memory. So, with some Java expertise, you can actually run your preset queries against the database in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are doing something similar. In creating an app/site for social science research collaboration, we found ourselves with immensely complex data models. We ended up writing several of the queries using the Gremlin Traversal Language (a subset of Groovy, which is, of course, Java at its heart), and then exposing those queries through the binary connection server of the OrientDB. So, the client opens a TCP socket, sends a short binary message, and the query is executing in Java directly against the in-memory database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OrientDB also supports writing function queries in Javascript, and you can use Node.js to interact directly with an Orient instance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For something of this size, I would want to use Orient in conjunction with Hadoop or something like that. You can also use Orient in conjunction with esper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider:&#xA;An introduction to orient: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/&quot;&gt;http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Complex, real-time queries: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/&quot;&gt;http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A discussion about streaming options with java and orient: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227&quot;&gt;https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="70" LastActivityDate="2014-05-17T04:18:10.020" CommentCount="1" />

For example, DBSCAN uses epsilon-neighborhoods around a point; there is nothing in there that specifically says the triangle inequality matters.  So you can probably use DBSCAN, although you may have to do some kind of nonstandard spatial index to do efficient lookups in your case.  Your version of epsilon-neighborhood will likely be sim &gt; 1/epsilon rather than the other way around.  Same story with k-means and related algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you construct a metric from your similarity?  One possibility: dist(ei, ej) = min( sim(ei, ek) + sim(ek, ej) ) for all k ...  Alternately, can you provide an upper  bound such that sim(ei, ej) &amp;lt; sim(ei, ek) + sim(ek, ej) + d, for all k and some positive constant d?  Intuitively, large sim values means closer together: is 1/sim metric-like?  What about 1/(sim + constant)?  What about min( 1/sim(ei, ek) + 1/sim(ek, ej) ) for all k? (that last is guaranteed to be a metric, btw)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternate construction of a metric is to do an embedding.  As a first step, you can try to map your points ei -&gt; xi, such that xi minimize sum( abs( sim(ei, ej) - f( dist(xi, xj) ) ), for some suitable function f and metric dist.  The function f converts distance in the embedding to a similarity-like value; you'd have to experiment a bit, but 1/dist or exp^-dist are good starting points.  You'd also have to experiment on the best dimension for xi.  From there, you can use conventional clustering on xi.  The idea here is that you can almost (in a best fit sense) convert your distances in the embedding to similarity values, so they would cluster correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the use of predefined parameters, all algorithms have some tuning.  DBSCAN can find the number of clusters, but you still need to give it some parameters.  In general, tuning requires multiple runs of the algorithm with different values for the tunable parameters, together with some function that evaluates goodness-of-clustering (either calculated separately, provided by the clustering algorithm itself, or just eyeballed :)  If the character of your data doesn't change, you can tune once and then use those fixed parameters; if it changes then you have to tune for each run.  You can find that out by tuning for each run and then comparing how well the parameters from one run work on another, compared to the parameters specifically tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="26" LastEditorUserId="26" LastEditDate="2014-05-18T09:17:15.557" LastActivityDate="2014-05-18T09:17:15.557" CommentCount="0" />

Further, distributed computing is very appealing for BigData processing, as it allows for exploiting disk parallelism (usually the bottleneck for large databases).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the level of parallelism, it may be taken rather as a constraint on the synchronization. For example, in GPGPU, which is single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD), the parallelism occurs by having different inputs for a single instruction, each pair &lt;em&gt;(data_i, instruction)&lt;/em&gt; being executed by a different thread. Such is the restraint that, in case of divergent branches, it is necessary to discard lots of unnecessary computations, until the threads reconverge. For CPU threads, though, they commonly diverge; yet, one may use synchronization structures to grant concurrent execution of specific sections of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2014-05-18T17:38:01.383" CommentCount="0" />

We can denote the parameters of the Dirichlet as a vector of size K of the form ~ 1/B(a) * Product(x_i ^ (a_i-1)), where a is the vector of size K of the parameters, and sum of x_i = 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the LDA uses some constructs like:&#xA;- a document can have multiple topics (because of this multiplicity, we need the Dirichlet distribution); and there is a Dirichlet distribution which models this relation&#xA;- words can also belong to multiple topics, when you consider them outside of a document; so here we need another Dirichlet to model this&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The previous two are distributions which you do not really see from data, this is why is called latent, or hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in Bayesian inference you use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior probability. For simplicity, let's say you have data &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and you have a model for this data governed by some parameters theta. In order to infer values for this parameters, in full Bayesian inference you will infer the posterior probability of these parameters using Bayes' rule with &lt;em&gt;p(theta|x) = p(x|theta)p(theta|alpha)/p(x|alpha)&lt;/em&gt;. In plain words is &lt;em&gt;posterior probability = likelihood x prior probability / marginal likelihood&lt;/em&gt;. Note that here comes an &lt;em&gt;alpha&lt;/em&gt;. This is your initial belief about this distribution, and is the parameter of the prior distribution. Usually this is chosen in such a way that will have a conjugate prior (so the distribution of the posterior is the same with the distribution of the prior) and often to encode some knowledge if you have one or to have maximum entropy if you know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The parameters of the prior are called &lt;em&gt;hyperparameters&lt;/em&gt;. So, in LDA, both topic distributions, over documents and over words have also correspondent priors, which are denoted usually with alpha and beta, and because are the parameters of the prior distributions are called hyperparameters. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now about choosing priors. If you plot some Dirichlet distributions you will note that if the individual parameters &lt;em&gt;alpha_k&lt;/em&gt; have the same value, the pdf is symmetric in the simplex defined by the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; values, which is the minimum or maximum for pdf is at the center. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all the alpha_k have values lower than unit the maximum is found at corners&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5khZE.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or can if all values alpha_k are the same and greater than 1 the maximum will be found in center like &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/prmlfigs-png/Figure2.5c.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that if values for alpha_k are not equal the symmetry is broken and the maximum will be found near bigger values. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional, please note that values for priors parameters produce smooth pdfs of the distribution as the values of the parameters are near 1. So if you have great confidence that something is clearly distributed in a way you know, with a high degree of confidence, than values far from 1 in absolute value are to be used, if you do not have such kind of knowledge than values near 1 would be encode this lack of knowledge. It is easy to see why 1 plays such a role in Dirichlet distribution from the formula of the distribution itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way to understand this is to see that prior encode prior-knowledge. In the same time you might think that prior encode some prior seen data. This data was not saw by the algorithm itself, it was saw by you, you learned something, and you can model prior according to what you know (learned). So in the prior parameters (hyperparameters) you encode also how big this data set you apriori saw, because the sum of alpha_k can be that also as the size of this more or less imaginary data set. So the bigger the prior data set, the bigger is the confidence, the bigger the values of alpha_k you can choose, the sharper the surface near maximum value, which means also less doubts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope it helped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: It's a hell to write something without LaTeX notation.

The tradeoffs that the communication overhead induce may force you to, for example, adopt a data-parallel paradigm to scale. That means a different choice of tools and algorithm.

Problems which run significantly slower on N quadruple c3 than on 2N double c3 are rare (an artificial example may be running multiple simple filters on a large number of images, where you go through all images for each filter rather than all filters for the same image).

MapReduce allows you to operate over huge amounts of data- with a lot of work put in to prevent failure due to hardware. MapReduce is a poor choice for computing results on the fly because it is slow. (A typical MapReduce job takes on the order of minutes or hours, not microseconds)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A MapReduce job takes a file (or some data store) as an input and writes a file of results. If you want these results available to an application, it is your responsibility to put this data in a place that is accessible. This is likely slow, and there will be a lag between the values you can display, and the values that represent your system in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important distinction to make when considering using MapReduce in building realtime systems is that of training your model, and applying your model. If you think your model parameters do not change quickly, you can fit them with MapReduce, and then have a mechanism for accessing these pre-fit parameters when you want to apply your model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storm&lt;/strong&gt;: A real-time, streaming computational system. Storm is online framework, meaning, in this sense, a service that interacts with a running application. In contrast to MapReduce, it receives small pieces of data (not a whole file) as they are processed in your application. You define a DAG of operations to perform on the data. A common and simple use case for Storm is tracking counters, and using that information to populate a real-time dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storm doesn't have anything (necessarily) to do with persisting your data. Here, streaming is another way to say keeping the information you care about and throwing the rest away. In reality, you probably have a persistence layer in your application that has already recorded the data, and so this a good and justified separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to know more...&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;If you would like to learn more about real-time systems that that fit parameters with MR and apply the models a different way &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/hbasecon-2013-24063525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here are slides for a talk I gave on building real-time recommendation engines on HBase.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An excellent paper that marries real-time counting and persistence in an interesting way is &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242610&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google News Personalization: Scalable Online Collaborative Filtering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting marriage of MR and Storm is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twitter/summingbird/wiki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SummingBird&lt;/a&gt;.

In fact, most frameworks have some sort of core infrastructure around which a core layer of basic functionality is implemented.  More specific functionality makes use of the basic layer and is placed in a second layer around the core.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now by shortcuts I mean going straight from a second layer routine to another second layer routine without using the core.  Typical example (from my domain) would be timestamps: You have a timestamped data source of some kind.  Thus far the job is simply to read the data off the wire and pass it to the core so your other code can feast on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now your industry changes the default timestamp format for a very good reason (in my case they went from unix time to GPS time).  Unless your framework is industry-specific it is very unlikely that they're willing to change the core representation of time, so you end up using a framework that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; does what you want.  Every time you access your data you have to convert it to industry-time-format first, and every time you want it modified you have to convert it back to whatever the core deems appropriate.  There is no way that you can hand over data straight from the source to a sink without double conversion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where your hand-crafted frameworks will shine, it's just a minor change and you're back modelling the real world whereas all other (non-industry-specific) frameworks will now have a performance disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the discrepancy between the real world and the model will add up.

But if, for some reason, you can't change the framework, i.e. you do have to put up with double conversion of data to go from one end to another, then you'd typically employ something that minimises the additional overhead.

When you repeat classification tests you will end up having multiple confusion matrices. The question is how to get a meaningful aggregate confusion matrix. The answer depends on what is the meaning of meaningful (pun intended). I think there is not a single version of meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way is to follow the rough idea of multiple testing. In general, you test something multiple times in order to get more accurate results. As a general principle one can reason that averaging on the results of the multiple tests reduces the variance of the estimates, so as a consequence, it increases the precision of the estimates. You can proceed in this way, of course, by summing position by position and then dividing by the number of tests. You can go further and instead of estimating only a value for each cell of the confusion matrix, you can also compute some confidence intervals, t-values and so on. This is OK from my point of view. But it tell only one side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other side of the story which might be investigated is how stable are the results for the same instances. To exemplify that I will take an extreme example. Suppose you have a classification model for 3 classes. Suppose that these classes are in the same proportion. If your model is able to predict one class perfectly and the other 2 classes with random like performance, you will end up having 0.33 + 0.166 + 0.166 = 0.66 misclassification ratio. This might seem good, but even if you take a look on a single confusion matrix you will not know that your performance on the last 2 classes varies wildly. Multiple tests can help. But averaging the confusion matrices would reveal this? My belief is not. The averaging will give the same result more or less, and doing multiple tests will only decrease the variance of the estimation. However it says nothing about the wild instability of prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So another way to do compose the confusion matrices would better involve a prediction density for each instance. One can build this density by counting for each instance, the number of times it was predicted a given class. After normalization, you will have for each instance a prediction density rather a single prediction label. You can see that a single prediction label is similar with a degenerated density where you have probability of 1 for the predicted class and 0 for the other classes for each separate instance. Now having this densities one can build a confusion matrix by adding the probabilities from each instance and predicted class to the corresponding cell of the aggregated confusion matrix. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can argue that this would give similar results like the previous method. However I think that this might be the case sometimes, often when the model has low variance, the second method is less affected by how the samples from the tests are drawn, and thus more stable and closer to the reality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also the second method might be altered in order to obtain a third method, where one can assign as prediction the label with highest density from the prediction of a given instance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not implemented those things but I plan to study further because I believe might worth spending some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastEditorUserId="108" LastEditDate="2014-06-11T09:39:34.373" LastActivityDate="2014-06-11T09:39:34.373" CommentCount="3" />

The main advantage of the database is the ability to work with data much larger than memory, to have random or indexed access, and to add/append/modify data quickly.  The main *dis*advantage is that it is much slower than HDF, for problems in which the entire dataset needs to be read in and processed.  Another disadvantage is that, with the exception of embedded-style databases like SQLite, a database is a system (requiring admnistration, setup, maintenance, etc) rather than a simple self-contained data store.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text file format options are XML/JSON/CSV.  They are cross-platform/language/toolkit, and are a good archival format due to the ability to be self-describing (or obvious :).  If uncompressed, they are huge (10x-100x HDF), but if compressed, they can be fairly space-efficient (compressed XML is about the same as HDF).  The main disadvantage here is again speed: parsing text is much, much slower than HDF.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other binary formats (npy/npz numpy files, blz blaze files, protocol buffers, Avro, ...) have very similar properties to HDF, except they are less widely supported (may be limited to just one platform: numpy) and may have specific other limitations.  They typically do not offer a compelling advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;HDF is a good complement to databases, it may make sense to run a query to produce a roughly memory-sized dataset and then cache it in HDF if the same data would be used more than once.  If you have a dataset which is fixed, and usually processed as a whole, storing it as a collection of appropriately sized HDF files is not a bad option.  If you have a dataset which is updated often, staging some of it as HDF files periodically might still be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, HDF is a good format for data which is read (or written) typically as a whole; it is the lingua franca or common/preferred interchange format for many applications due to wide support and compatibility, decent as an archival format, and very fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. To give this some practical context, my most recent experience comparing HDF to alternatives, a certain small (much less than memory-sized) dataset took 2 seconds to read as HDF (and most of this is probably overhead from Pandas); ~1 minute to read from JSON; and 1 &lt;em&gt;hour&lt;/em&gt; to write to database.  Certainly the database write could be sped up, but you'd better have a good DBA!

Having&#xA;  ad hoc analysis to all of the detailed data allows the group to detect anomalies across&#xA;  certain asset classes and identify suspicious behavior. Users previously relied solely on&#xA;  desktop spreadsheet tools. Now, with Datameer and Cloudera, users have a powerful&#xA;  platform that allows them to sift through more data more quickly and avert potential&#xA;  losses before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A leading retail bank is using Cloudera and Datameer to validate data accuracy and quality&#xA;  as required by the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations. Integrating loan and branch data&#xA;  as well as wealth management data, the bank’s data quality initiative is responsible for&#xA;  ensuring that every record is accurate. The process includes subjectingthe data to over&#xA;  50 data sanity and quality checks. The results of those checks are trended over time to&#xA;  ensure that the tolerances for data corruption and data domains aren’t changing adversely&#xA;  and that the risk profiles being reported to investors and regulatory agencies are prudent&#xA;  and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The results are reported through a data&#xA;  quality dashboard to the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who are ultimately&#xA;  responsible for ensuring the accuracy of regulatory compliance reporting as well as&#xA;  earnings forecasts to investors&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn't see any other finance related studies at Cloudera, but I didn't search very hard.

Perhaps most importantly, you can't run any type of custom functions on Redshift. In Hadoop you can, using many languages (Java, Python, Ruby.. you name it). For example, NLP in Hadoop is easy, while it's more or less impossible in Redshift. I.e. there are lots of things you can do in Hadoop but not on Redshift. This is probably the most important difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Performance Profile&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Query execution on Redshift is in most cases significantly more efficient than on Hadoop. However, this efficiency comes from the indexing that is done when the data is loaded into Redshift (I'm using the term &lt;code&gt;indexing&lt;/code&gt; very loose here). Therefore, it's great if you load your data once and execute multiple queries, but if you want to execute only one query for example, you might actually lose out in performance overall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Cost Profile&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Which solution wins out in cost depends on the situation (like performance), but you probably need quite a lot of queries in order to make it cheaper than Hadoop (more specifically Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce). For example, if you are doing OLAP, it's very likely that Redshift comes out cheaper. If you do daily batch ETLs, Hadoop is more likely to come out cheaper.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, we've replaced part of our ETL that was done in Hive to Redshift, and it was a pretty great experience; mostly for the ease of development. Redshift's Query Engine is based on PostgreSQL and is very mature, compared to Hive's. Its ACID characteristics make it easier to reason about it, and the quicker response time allows more testing to be done. It's a great tool to have, but it won't replace Hadoop.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  As for setup complexity, I'd even say it's easier with Hadoop if you use AWS's EMR. Their tools are so mature that it's ridiculously easy to have your Hadoop job running. Tools and mechanisms surrounding Redshift's operation aren't that mature yet. For example, Redshift can't handle trickle loading and thus you have to come up with something that turns that into a batched load, which can add some complexity to your ETL. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="638" LastEditorUserId="638" LastEditDate="2014-06-11T09:07:33.570" LastActivityDate="2014-06-11T09:07:33.570" CommentCount="2" />

All languages were designed to make some type of constructs more easy to build than others. And the knowledge and mastery of a programming language is more important and effective than the features of that language compared to others.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see there are two dimensions of this question. The first dimension is the ability to explore, build proof of concepts or models at a fast pace, eventually having at hand enough tools to study what is going on (like statistical tests, graphics, measurement tools, etc). This kind of activity is usually preferred by researchers and data scientists (I always wonder what that means, but I use this term for its loose definition). They tend to rely on well-known and verified instruments, which can be used for proofs or arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second dimension is the ability to extend, change, improve or even create tools, algorithms or models. In order to achieve that you need a proper programming language. Roughly all of them are the same. If you work for a company, than you depend a lot on the company's infrastructure, internal culture and your choices diminish significantly. Also, when you want to implement an algorithm for production use, you have to trust the implementation. And implementing in another language which you do not master will not help you much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to favor for the first type of activity the R ecosystem. You have a great community, a huge set of tools, proofs that these tools works as expected. Also, you can consider Python, Octave (to name a few), which are reliable candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the second task, you have to think before at what you really want. If you want robust production ready tools, then C/C++, Java, C# are great candidates. I consider Python as a second citizen in this category, together with Scala and friends. I do not want to start a flame war, it's my opinion only. But after more than 17 years as a developer, I tend to prefer a strict contract and my knowledge, than the freedom to do whatever you might think of (like it happens with a lot of dynamic languages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I want to learn as much as possible. I decided that I have to choose the hard way, which means to implement myself everything from scratch. I use R as a model and inspiration. It has great treasures in libraries and a lot of experience distilled. However, as a programming language R, for me at least is a nightmare. So I decided to use Java, and use no additional library. That is only because of my experience, and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have time, the best thing you can do is to spend some time with all these things. In this way you will earn for yourself the best answer possible, fitted for you. Dijkstra said once that the tools influence the way you think, so it is advisable to know your tools before letting them to model how you think. You can read more about that in his famous paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Humble Programmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastEditorUserId="733" LastEditDate="2014-06-12T11:16:51.183" LastActivityDate="2014-06-12T11:16:51.183" CommentCount="0" />

To give you an example, suppose you have a binary classification model, with classes c1 and c2. For a given instance, your classifier would have to return a score for c1 and another for c2. If this score is a probability-like (preferrable), than something like p(c1), p(c2) would work. In plain English is translated like &quot;I (the model) classify this instance as c1 with probability p(c1), and as c2 with probability  p(c2)=1-p(c1)&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This applies for all type of classifiers, not only for decision trees. Having these scores you can than compute ROC or AUC by varying a threshold on p(c1) values, from the smallest to the greatest value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have an implementation of a decision tree and you want to change that implementation to return scores instead of labels you have to compute those values. The most used way for decision trees is to use the proportion of classes from the leaf nodes. So, for example you have built a decision tree and when you predict the class for an instance you arrive at a leaf node which have (stored from the learning phase) 10 instances of class c1 and 15 instances of class c2, you can use the ratios as the scores. So, in our example, you would return p(c1) = 10 / (10+15) = 0.4 probability of class c1 and p(c2) = 15/(10+15)=0.6 probability of being class c2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For further reading on the ROC curves, the best and inspiring source of information I found to be the Tom Fawcett paper called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;amp;url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf&amp;amp;ei=DYCZU96QGPOV7AaAx4CgBA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNECLoecin6ieT-0ymLQ--FoMjkMZw&amp;amp;sig2=3bGE2y1N3I2Re_YWn0EDFA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;An Introduction to ROC Analysis&lt;/a&gt;, it's solid gold on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2014-06-12T10:27:14.480" CommentCount="0" />

Model Building and Prediction phase. Typically, model building is performed as a batch process and &lt;strong&gt;predictions are done realtime&lt;/strong&gt;. The model building process is a compute intensive process while the prediction happens in a jiffy. Therefore, performance of an algorithm in Python or R doesn't really affect the turn-around time of the user. Python 1, R 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production:&lt;/strong&gt; The real difference between Python and R comes in being production ready. Python, as such is a full fledged programming language and many organisations use it in their production systems. R is a statistical programming software favoured by many academia and due to the rise in data science and availability of libraries and being open source, the industry has started using R. Many of these organisations have their production systems either in Java, C++, C#, Python etc. So, ideally they would like to have the &lt;strong&gt;prediction system&lt;/strong&gt; in the same language to reduce the latency and maintenance issues.&#xA;Python 2, R 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the languages have enormous and reliable libraries. R has over 5000 libraries catering to many domains while Python has some incredible packages like &lt;strong&gt;Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib&lt;/strong&gt;. Python 3, R 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the language are interpreted languages. Many say that python has a good learning curve, it's almost like reading english (to put it on a lighter note) but R has a reputation of having a steeper learning curve. Also, both of them have good IDEs (Spyder etc for Python and RStudio for R). Python 4, R 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; R software initially had problems with large computations (say, like nxn matrix multiplications). But, this issue is addressed with the introduction of R by Revolution Analytics. They have re-written computation intensive operations in C which is blazingly fast. Python being a high level language is relatively slow. Python 4, R 3.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt; In data science, we frequently tend to plot data to showcase patterns to users. Therefore, visualisations become an important criteria in choosing a software and R completely kills Python in this regard. Thanks to Hadley Wickham for an incredible ggplot2 package. R wins hands down. Python 4, R 4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with Big Data:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the constraints of R is it stores the data in system memory (RAM). So, RAM capacity becomes a constraint when you are handling Big Data. Python does well, but I would say, as both R and Python have HDFS connectors, leveraging Hadoop infrastructure would give substantial performance improvement. So, Python 5, R 5.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, both the languages are equally good. Therefore, depending upon your domain and the place you work, you have got to smartly choose the right language. Technology world usually prefers single language. Business users (marketing analytics, retail analytics) usually go with statistical programming language R since they frequently do quick prototyping and build visualisations which is faster do in R.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="514" LastActivityDate="2014-06-12T12:59:00.663" CommentCount="5" />

Naturally you are trying to build a model that predicts how if a person defaults on their loan.  Lets keep this simple and say that the outcomes are either full payment, or default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a business perspective you can sum up a models performance with a contingency matrix:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RgWr9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the model predicts someone is going to default, do they?  To determining the downsides of over and under fitting I find it helpful to think of it as an optimization problem, because in each cross section of predicted verses actual model performance there is either a cost or profit to be made:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/78kH2.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this example predicting a default that is a default means avoiding any risk, and predicted a non-default which doesn't default will make $50 per loan issued.  Where things get dicey is when you are wrong, if you default when you predicted non-default you lose the entire loan principal and if you predict default when a customer actually would not have you suffer $50 of missed opportunity.  The numbers here are not important, just the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this framework we can now begin to understand the difficulties associated with over and under fitting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over fitting in this case would mean that your model works far better on you development/test data then it does in production.  Or to put it another way, your model in production will far underperform what you saw in development, this false confidence will probably cause you to take on far more risky loans then you otherwise would and leaves you very vulnerable to losing money.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, under fitting in this context will leave you with a model that just does a poor job of matching reality.  While the results of this can be wildly unpredictable, (the opposite word you want to describe your predictive models), commonly what happens is standards are tightened up to compensate for this, leading to less overall customers leading to lost good customers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under fitting suffers a kind of opposite difficulty that over fitting does, which is under fitting gives you lower confidence.  Insidiously, the lack of predictability still leads you to take on unexpected risk, all of which is bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience the best way to avoid both of these situations is validating your model on data that is completely outside the scope of your training data, so you can have some confidence that you have a representative sample of what you will see &quot;in the wild&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is always a good practice to revalidate your models periodically, to determine how quickly your model is degrading, and if it is still accomplishing your objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to some things up, your model is under fitted when it does a poor job of predicting both the development and production data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="780" LastActivityDate="2014-06-13T20:13:01.913" CommentCount="0" />

There are a large number of reasons for this, but I'm going to build on some of the points that other people have mentioned here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking a single language:&lt;/strong&gt; It's definitely possible to mix and match languages, picking &lt;code&gt;d3&lt;/code&gt; for your visualization needs, &lt;code&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/code&gt; for your fast matrix multiplies, and &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; for all of your networking and scripting. You can do this down the line, but keeping your stack as simple as possible is a good move, especially early on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking something bigger than you:&lt;/strong&gt; You never want to be pushing up against the barriers of the language you want to use. This is a huge issue when it comes to languages like &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/code&gt;, which simply don't offer the full functionality of languages like &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick Community&lt;/strong&gt;: The one most difficult thing to find in any language is community. &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; is the clear winner here. If you get stuck, you ask something on SO, and someone will answer in a matter of minutes, which is simply not the case for most other languages. If you're learning something in a vacuum you will simply learn much slower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the minus points, I might actually push back on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deepening your knowledge of one language is a decent idea, but knowing &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one language, without having practice generalizing that knowledge to other languages is a good way to shoot yourself in the foot. I have changed my entire favored development stack three time over as many years, moving from &lt;code&gt;MATLAB&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Java&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;haskell&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. Learning to transfer your knowledge to another language is far more valuable than just knowing one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as feasibility, this is something you're going to see again and again in any programming career. Turing completeness means you could technically do everything with &lt;code&gt;HTML4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CSS3&lt;/code&gt;, but you want to pick the right tool for the job. If you see the ideal tool and decide to leave it by the roadside you're going to find yourself slowed down wishing you had some of the tools you left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great example of that last point is trying to deploy &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; code. 'R''s networking capabilities are hugely lacking compared to &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, and if you want to deploy a service, or use slightly off-the-beaten path packages, the fact that &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; has an order of magnitude more packages than &lt;code&gt;CRAN&lt;/code&gt; is a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="548" LastActivityDate="2014-06-16T15:00:04.577" CommentCount="5" />

Our usual approach here is to withhold data entirely, or in some cases to reduce its resolution; e.g., replacing an exact street address with the corresponding county or census tract. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that certain types of analysis and processing must be done in-house, even when a third party has resources and expertise more suited to the task. Since the source data is not disclosed, the way we go about this analysis and processing lacks transparency. As a result, any third party's ability to perform QA/QC, adjust parameters or make refinements may be very limited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Anonymizing Confidential Data&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One task involves identifying individuals by their names, in user-submitted data, while taking into account errors and inconsistencies. A private individual might be recorded in one place as &quot;Dave&quot; and in another as &quot;David,&quot; commercial entities can have many different abbreviations, and there are always some typos. I've developed scripts based on a number of criteria that determine when two records with non-identical names represent the same individual, and assign them a common ID. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point we can make the dataset anonymous by withholding the names and replacing them with this personal ID number. But this means the recipient has almost no information about e.g. the strength of the match. We would prefer to be able to pass along as much information as possible without divulging identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What Doesn't Work&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, it would be great to be able to encrypt strings while preserving edit distance. This way, third parties could do some of their own QA/QC, or choose to do further processing on their own, without ever accessing (or being able to potentially reverse-engineer) PII. Perhaps we match strings in-house with edit distance &amp;lt;= 2, and the recipient wants to look at the implications of tightening that tolerance to edit distance &amp;lt;= 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the only method I am familiar with that does this is ROT13, which hardly even counts as encryption; it's like writing the names upside down and saying, &quot;promise you won't flip the paper over?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; solution would be to abbreviate everything. &quot;Ellen Roberts&quot; becomes &quot;ER&quot; and so forth. This is a poor solution because in some cases the initials, in association with public data, will reveal a person's identity, and in other cases it's too ambiguous; &quot;Benjamin Othello Ames&quot; and &quot;Bank of America&quot; will have the same initials, but their names are otherwise dissimilar. So it doesn't do either of the things we want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An inelegant alternative is to introduce additional fields to track certain attributes of the name, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| Row | ID | Name              | WordChars | Origin |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 1   | 17 | &quot;AMELIA BEDELIA&quot;  | (6, 7)    | Eng    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 2   | 18 | &quot;CHRISTOPH BAUER&quot; | (9, 5)    | Ger    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 3   | 18 | &quot;C J BAUER&quot;       | (1, 1, 5) | Ger    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;| 4   | 19 | &quot;FRANZ HELLER&quot;    | (5, 6)    | Ger    |&#xA;+-----+----+-------------------+-----------+--------+&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I call this &quot;inelegant&quot; because it requires anticipating which qualities might be interesting and it's relatively coarse. If the names are removed, there's not much you can reasonably conclude about the strength of the match between rows 2 &amp;amp; 3, or about the distance between rows 2 &amp;amp; 4 (i.e., how close they are to matching).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to transform strings in such a way that as many useful qualities of the original string are preserved as possible while obscuring the original string.

As far as GPU acceleration goes, &lt;code&gt;cudamat&lt;/code&gt; is a really seamless way of getting it working with &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;cuda&lt;/code&gt; library in general has made GPU acceleration far more accessible than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two primary metrics I use for both community and flexibility are to look at the language's package manager, and the language questions on a site like SO. If there are a large number of high-quality questions and answers, it's a good sign that the community is active. Number of packages and the general activity on those packages can also be a good proxy for this metric.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as ease of use goes, I am a firm believer that the only way to actually know is to actually set it up yourself. There's a lot of superstition around a lot of Data Science tools, specifically things like databases and distributed computing architecture, but there's no way to really know if something is easy or hard to setup up and deploy without just building it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="548" LastActivityDate="2014-06-16T20:10:12.167" CommentCount="2" />

The protocol is based on Bloom filters on q-grams of identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article goes into detail about the method, which I will summarize here to the best of my ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Bloom filter is a fixed-length series of bits storing the results of a fixed set of independent hash functions, each computed on the same input value. The output of each hash function should be an index value from among the possible indexes in the filter; i.e., if you have a 0-indexed series of 10 bits, hash functions should return (or be mapped to) values from 0 to 9. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The filter starts with each bit set to 0. After hashing the input value with each function from the set of hash functions, each bit corresponding to an index value returned by any hash function is set to 1. If the same index is returned by more than one hash function, the bit at that index is only set once. You could consider the Bloom filter to be a superposition of the set of hashes onto the fixed range of bits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The protocol described in the above-linked article divides strings into n-grams, which are in this case sets of characters. As an example, &lt;code&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt; might yield the following set of 2-grams:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&quot;_h&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;el&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;o_&quot;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Padding the front and back with spaces seems to be generally optional when constructing n-grams; the examples given in the paper that proposes this method use such padding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each n-gram can be hashed to produce a Bloom filter, and this set of Bloom filters can be superimposed on itself (bitwise OR operation) to produce the Bloom filter for the string.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the filter contains many more bits than there are hash functions or n-grams, arbitrary strings are relatively unlikely to produce exactly the same filter. However, the more n-grams two strings have in common, the more bits their filters will ultimately share. You can then compare any two filters &lt;code&gt;A, B&lt;/code&gt; by means of their Dice coefficient:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;A, B&lt;/sub&gt; = 2h / (a + b)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits that are set to 1 in both filters, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits set to 1 in &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; filter A, and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits set to 1 in &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; filter B. If the strings are exactly the same, the Dice coefficient will be 1; the more they differ, the closer the coefficient will be to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the hash functions are mapping an indeterminate number of unique inputs to a small number of possible bit indexes, different inputs may produce the same filter, so the coefficient indicates only a &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt; that the strings are the same or similar. The number of different hash functions and the number of bits in the filter are important parameters for determining the likelihood of false positives - pairs of inputs that are much less similar than the Dice coefficient produced by this method predicts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to be very helpful for understanding the Bloom filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some flexibility in the implementation of this method; see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uni-due.de/~hq0215/documents/2010/Bachteler_2010_An_Empirical_Comparison_Of_Approaches_To_Approximate_String_Matching_In_Private_Record_Linkage.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this 2010 paper&lt;/a&gt; (also linked at the end of the question) for some indications of how performant it is in relation to other methods, and with various parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-18T15:08:44.507" LastActivityDate="2014-06-18T15:08:44.507" CommentCount="1" />

Many similarities in to the way I’m thinking of approaching the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main issue on mapping the attributes is that the level of detail to which the product should be described depends on each buyers. Let’s take an example of a car. The product “car” has lots and lots of attributes that range from its performance, mechanical structure, price etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose I just want a cheap car, or an electric car. Ok, that’s easy to map because they represent main features of this product. But let’s say, for instance, that I want a car with Dual-Clutch transmission or Xenon headlights. Well there might be many cars on the data base with this attributes but I wouldn’t ask the seller to fill in this level of detail to their product prior to the information that there is someone looking them.  Such a procedure would require every seller fill a complex, very detailed, form just try to sell his car on the platform. Just wouldn’t work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But still, my challenge is to try to be as detailed as necessary in the search to make a good match. So the way I’m thinking is mapping main aspects of the product, those that are probably relevant to everyone, to narrow down de group of potential sellers.&#xA;Next step would be a “refined search”. In order to avoid creating a too detailed form I could ask buyers and sellers to write a free text of their specification. And then use some word matching algorithm to find possible matches. Although I understand that this is not a proper solution to the problem because the seller cannot “guess” what the buyer needs.  But might get me close.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The weighting criteria suggested is great.  It allows me to quantify the level to which the seller matches the buyer’s needs.  The scaling part might be a problem though, because the importance of each attribute varies from client to client. I’m thinking of using some kind of pattern recognition or just asking de buyer to input the level of importance of each attribute. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a native English speaker so hope I’m being able to express my ideas properly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="986" LastEditorUserId="21" LastEditDate="2014-06-27T22:58:13.613" LastActivityDate="2014-06-27T22:58:13.613" Title="Preference Matching Algorithm" Tags="&lt;bigdata&gt;&lt;text-mining&gt;&lt;recommendation&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" />

Instead, they use transformations to expand the domain of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to all real numbers.  This transformation is called the link function.

And final data table would be extremely sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first step is narrowing customers (products) list for matching. Let’s build a bipartite graph, where sellers would be type-1 nodes, and buyers would be type-2 nodes. Create an edge between any seller and buyer every time they reference a similar product feature, as in the following sketch:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/q1JTN.png&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the above graph, for every unique seller’s product you can select only buyers who are interested in features that match the product (it’s possible to filter &lt;strong&gt;at least one&lt;/strong&gt; common feature, match the full set of features, or set a threshold level). But certainly, that’s not enough. The next step is to compare feature values, as described by the seller and buyer. There are a lot of variants (e.g., k-Nearest-Neighbors). But why not try to solve this question using the existing graph? Let’s add weights to the edges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;for continuous features (e.g., price): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Cprice_%7Bsell%7D%20-%20price_%7Bbuy%7D%7C%7D%7B%5Cmax%28price%29%20-%20%5Cmin%28price%29%7D&quot; alt=&quot;price_weight&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;for binary and non-quantifiable features - just logical biconditional:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=weight%20%3D%20feature_%7Bsell%7D%20%5Cleftrightarrow%20feature_%7Bbuy%7D&quot; alt=&quot;feature_weight&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main idea here is to &lt;strong&gt;scale&lt;/strong&gt; every feature to the interval &lt;code&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, we can use feature coefficients to determine most important features. E.g., assuming price is twice as important as availability of some rare function: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=adj.price.weight%20%3D%202%20%5Ctimes%20price.weight&quot; alt=&quot;adj_w_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;amp;chl=adj.feature.weight%20%3D%201%20%5Ctimes%20feature.weight&quot; alt=&quot;adj_w_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the final steps is simplifying the graph structure and reducing many edges to one edge with weight equal to the sum of the previously calculated weights of each feature. With such a reduced structure every pair of customers/products could have only one edge (no parallel edges). So, to find the best deal for exact seller you just need to select connected buyers with max weighted edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Future challenge: introduce a cheap method for weighting edges on first step :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="941" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-20T03:28:55.463" LastActivityDate="2014-06-20T03:28:55.463" CommentCount="0" />

For example, if user &lt;code&gt;bbb&lt;/code&gt; is in your concatenated table five times, then you know that person made your list all five months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer you second question, you could do a &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt; operation to compute some aggregate function of the users. A &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt; operation with an average function is a little crude and sensitive to outliers, but it would probably get you close to what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possibility for the third question is to compute the difference in threat score between month &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt; and month &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. That is, for each month (not including the first month) you subtract the user's previous threat score from the current threat score. You can make this a new column so your table would now look like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;User-id | Threat_score | month | difference&#xA;aaa       45             1       null&#xA;bbb       32             1       null&#xA;ccc       20             1       null&#xA;...       ...            ...     ...&#xA;bbb       64             2       32&#xA;ccc       29             2       9&#xA;...       ...            ...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this table, you could again do a &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt; operation to find people who consistently have a higher threat score than the previous month or you could simply find people with a large difference between the current month and the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you suggest, visualizing this data is a really good idea.

So, from a statistical perspective, a model is assumed and given various assumptions the errors are treated and the model parameters and other questions are inferred. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning comes from a computer science perspective. The models are algorithmic and usually very few assumptions are required regarding the data. We work with hypothesis space and learning bias. The best exposition of machine learning I found is contained in Tom Mitchell's book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a more exhaustive and complete idea regarding the two cultures you can read the Leo Broiman paper called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http://strimmerlab.org/courses/ss09/current-topics/download/breiman2001.pdf&amp;amp;ei=RQGkU_DgH8Le7AaRmID4DA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGNnrlqadmBT2fZMT_NfoUQ1rEuow&amp;amp;sig2=g5qovUTsuuJUGGE64g0nrQ&quot;&gt;Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However what must be added is that even if the two sciences started with different perspectives, both of them now now share a fair amount of common knowledge and techniques. Why, because the problems were the same, but the tools were different. So now machine learning is mostly treated from a statistical perspective (check the Hastie,Tibshirani, Friedman book &lt;a href=&quot;http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/&quot;&gt;The Elements of Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; from a machine learning point of view with a statistical treatement, and perhaps Kevin P. Murphy 's book &lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-2&quot;&gt;Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective&lt;/a&gt;, to name just a few of the best books available today). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even the history of the development of this field show the benefits of this merge of perspectives. I will describe two events. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is the creation of CART trees, which was created by Breiman with a solid statistical background. At approximately the same time, Quinlan developed ID3,C45,See5, and so on, decision tree suite with a more computer science background. Now both this families of trees and the ensemble methods like bagging and forests become quite similar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second story is about boosting. Initially they were developed by Freund and Shapire when they discovered AdaBoost. The choices for designing AdaBoost were done mostly from a computational perspective. Even the authors did not understood well why it works. Only 5 years later Breiman (again!) described the adaboost model from a statistical perspective and gave an explanation for why that works. Since then, various eminent scientists, with both type of backgrounds, developed further those ideas leading to a Pleiads of boosting algorithms, like logistic boosting, gradient boosting, gentle boosting ans so on. It is hard now to think at boosting without a solid statistical background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GLM is a statistical development. However new Bayesian treatments puts this algorithm also in machine learning playground. So I believe both claims could be right, since the interpretation and treatment of how it works could be different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2014-06-20T10:01:03.363" CommentCount="1" />

I hope we get a bunch of real world examples of data problems and several perspectives on how best to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use p-values as they can be pretty misleading (&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/03/12/misunderstanding-the-p-value/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://occamstypewriter.org/boboh/2008/08/19/why_p_values_are_evil/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). My approach hinges on you being able to summarize traffic on a given page before and after some intervention. What you care about is the difference in the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; before and after the intervention. That is, how does the number of hits per day change? Below, I explain a first stab approach with some simulated example data. I will then explain one potential pitfall (and what I would do about it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, let's think about one page before and after an intervention. Pretend the intervention increases hits per day by roughly 15%:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&#xA;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&#xA;import seaborn as sns&#xA;&#xA;def simulate_data(true_diff=0):&#xA;    #First choose a number of days between [1, 1000] before the intervention&#xA;    num_before = np.random.randint(1, 1001)&#xA;&#xA;    #Next choose a number of days between [1, 1000] after the intervention&#xA;    num_after = np.random.randint(1, 1001)&#xA;&#xA;    #Next choose a rate for before the intervention. How many views per day on average?&#xA;    rate_before = np.random.randint(50, 151)&#xA;&#xA;    #The intervention causes a `true_diff` increase on average (but is also random)&#xA;    rate_after = np.random.normal(1 + true_diff, .1) * rate_before&#xA;&#xA;    #Simulate viewers per day:&#xA;    vpd_before = np.random.poisson(rate_before, size=num_before)&#xA;    vpd_after = np.random.poisson(rate_after, size=num_after)&#xA;&#xA;    return vpd_before, vpd_after&#xA;&#xA;vpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)&#xA;&#xA;plt.hist(vpd_before, histtype=&quot;step&quot;, bins=20, normed=True, lw=2)&#xA;plt.hist(vpd_after, histtype=&quot;step&quot;, bins=20, normed=True, lw=2)&#xA;plt.legend((&quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;))&#xA;plt.title(&quot;Views per day before and after intervention&quot;)&#xA;plt.xlabel(&quot;Views per day&quot;)&#xA;plt.ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;)&#xA;plt.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/FJJqD.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of hits per day before and after the intervention&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see that the intervention increased the number of hits per day, on average. But in order to quantify the difference in rates, we should use one company's intervention for multiple pages. Since the underlying rate will be different for each page, we should compute the percent change in rate (again, the rate here is hits per day).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's pretend we have data for &lt;code&gt;n = 100&lt;/code&gt; pages, each of which received an intervention from the same company. To get the percent difference we take (mean(hits per day before) - mean(hits per day after)) / mean(hits per day before):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;n = 100&#xA;&#xA;pct_diff = np.zeros(n)&#xA;&#xA;for i in xrange(n):&#xA;    vpd_before, vpd_after = simulate_data(.15)&#xA;    # % difference. Note: this is the thing we want to infer&#xA;    pct_diff[i] = (vpd_after.mean() - vpd_before.mean()) / vpd_before.mean()&#xA;&#xA;plt.hist(pct_diff)&#xA;plt.title(&quot;Distribution of percent change&quot;)&#xA;plt.xlabel(&quot;Percent change&quot;)&#xA;plt.ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;)&#xA;plt.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CAitf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of percent change&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we have the distribution of our parameter of interest! We can query this result in different ways. For example, we might want to know the mode, or (approximation of) the most likely value for this percent change:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def mode_continuous(x, num_bins=None):&#xA;    if num_bins is None:&#xA;        counts, bins = np.histogram(x)&#xA;    else:&#xA;        counts, bins = np.histogram(x, bins=num_bins)&#xA;&#xA;    ndx = np.argmax(counts)&#xA;    return bins[ndx:(ndx+1)].mean()&#xA;&#xA;mode_continuous(pct_diff, 20)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I ran this I got 0.126, which is not bad, considering our true percent change is 15. We can also see the number of positive changes, which approximates the probability that a given company's intervention improves hits per day:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pct_diff &amp;gt; 0).mean()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, my result is 0.93, so we could say there's a pretty good chance that this company is effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a potential pitfall: Each page probably has some underlying trend that you should probably account for. That is, even without the intervention, hits per day may increase. To account for this, I would estimate a simple linear regression where the outcome variable is hits per day and the independent variable is day (start at day=0 and simply increment for all the days in your sample). Then subtract the estimate, y_hat, from each number of hits per day to de-trend your data. Then you can do the above procedure and be confident that a positive percent difference is not due to the underlying trend. Of course, the trend may not be linear, so use discretion!

Basically, everyone in marketing would come up with a crazy idea that the sold to higher ups as the single event that would boost KPI's by 2000%.  The higher ups would approve them and then they would begin their &quot;test&quot;.  Results would come back, and management would dump it on the data analysts to determine what worked and who did it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is you cant really know if it wasn't run as a random A/B style test on like time periods.  But I am very aware of how deficient that answer is, especially if the fact that a pure answer doesn't exist is irrelevant to the urgency of future business decisions.  Here are some of the techniques I would use to salvage the analysis in this situation, bear in mind this is more of an art then a science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A handle is something that exists in the data that you can hold onto.  From what you are telling me in your situation you have a lot of info on who the marketing agency is, when they tried a tactic, and to which site they applied it to.  These are your starting point and information like this going to be the corner stone of your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methodology is going to probably hold the strongest impact on which agencies are given credit for any and all gains so you are going to need to make sure that it is clearly outlines and all stake holders agree that it makes sense.  If you cant do that it is going to be difficult for people to trust your analysis.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of this are conversions. Say the marketing department purchases some leads and they arrive at our landing page, we would track them for 3 days, if they made a purchase within that time we would count them as having been converted.  Why 3 days, why not 5 or 1?  Thats not important as long as everyone agrees, you now have a definition you can build off of.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparisons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal would you would have a nice A/B test to prove a definitive relationship, I am going to assume that you are running short on those, still, you can learn something from a simple comparison of like data.  When companies are trying to determine the efficacy of radio advertising they will often run ads on offset months in the same market, or for several months in one market and compare that with the results in a separate but similar market.  Its doesn't pass for science, but even with all that noise a strong results will almost always be noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would combine these in your case to determine how long an event is given to register an effect.  Once you have the data from that time period run it against your modeled out traffic prediction, week over week growth, month over month etc. Which, can then allow a meaningful comparison between agencies, and across time periods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pragmatism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aspiration is to be able to provide a deep understanding of cause and effect, but it is probably not realistic.  Because of how messy outside factors make your analysis, you are constantly going to run up against the question over and over again: Did this event raise volume/sales/click throughs, or would doing anything at all have had the same effect?  The best advise I can give for this is set very realistic goals for what you are looking to measure.  A good starting point is, within the methodology you have, which event had the largest impact.  Once you have those open your aperture from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have reasoned out all of these aspects you can go about building a general solution which can then be automated.  The advantage to designing your solution in this manner is that the business logic is already built in.  This will make your results much more approachable and intuitive to non-technical business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="780" LastActivityDate="2014-06-20T16:29:27.673" CommentCount="1" />

Any scientists who claim that their work is entirely objective and rational are in denial about the nature of science; every single model we create is informed by our biases and perspectives. The key is that we each have different biases and perspectives, which is one reason that science is the pursuit of a society, not of individuals, and underscores the importance of peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have already identified some trade-offs between an algorithmic solution and individual/case-by-case corrections. If we have training as scientists, we may be used to thinking that everything has to be applied as an overall rule, so we may bend over backwards to find correlations and fit curves to data that just won't reasonably accept it. Applying an algorithm to the entire data set can be powerful when it works, but it's not the only tool at your disposal. Sometimes you need to use your judgment as the scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, if you use your individual judgment to make exceptions and to manually correct your data, be prepared to defend your judgment and argue your case. Be prepared to show that you considered all the data. If you're going to manually correct 8 observations out of a set of 100,000, you need to do more than justify those 8 manual corrections - you also need to justify &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; correcting the other 99,992 observations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can still take a methodical approach, perhaps by classifying your data in a systematic way, and choosing which subset of the data to apply your cleaning algorithm to based on that system of classification. And when you do this, you document it, you make your case, and you respect the judgment of your colleagues in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, why do all this extra work before you know it's necessary? Plenty of &quot;dirty&quot; data sets will still produce useful results. Perhaps 0.5% of your data is &quot;dirty&quot; in a way that you know will have a bad influence on your end product. Well, any analysis is subject to error, and the more you obsess over that 0.5% the more you will start to think of it and treat it like it was 5%, or 25% - much more significant than it truly is. Try to apply your analysis while admitting you know there is some error, and only do extra work to clean the data once you can show for certain that your analysis fails or is not useful otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;For example...&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say you have a set of test results from a survey of wells, showing the concentrations of certain dissolved substances, hourly over the course of a year. And you observe in this set certain spikes, of short duration, and orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding data. If they are few, and obvious, and you know that the sensors used to produce the data set occasionally malfunction, then there's no reason to apply an algorithmic solution to the entire data set. You have a choice between excluding some data or modifying it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recommend the exclusion route whenever possible, since you are making fewer assumptions when you don't have to additionally choose a &quot;correct&quot; value. But if your analysis will absolutely fail with a discontinuity, there are many options. You could choose to replace &quot;bad&quot; values via linear interpolation. You could hold constant the previous value. If there is some great previous literature to apply, and you really have a strong case that the &quot;bad&quot; data is purely due to equipment malfunction, perhaps there's an established model that you can apply to fill in those regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a great many approaches, which is why the most important thing is to document your process, explicitly and exhaustively. Arguing your case is important too, but not strictly necessary; the community is just more likely to ignore you if you don't make a full effort to engage the review process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-23T16:14:33.900" LastActivityDate="2014-06-23T16:14:33.900" CommentCount="2" />

But I used users' ego-networks, not visited sites statistics. And I faced with two almost independent tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;'Restoring' or 'predicting' data. You can use a bunch of different technics to complete this task, but my vote is for simplest ones (KISS, yes). E.g., in my case, for age prediction, mean of ego-network users' ages gave satisfactory results (for about 70% of users error was less than +/-3 years, in my case it was enough). It's just an idea, but you can try to use for age prediction weighted average, defining weight as similarity measure between visited sites sets of current user and others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Evaluating prediction quality. Algorithm from task-1 will produce prediction almost in all cases. And second task is to determine, if prediction is reliable. E.g., in case of ego network and age prediction: can we trust in prediction, if a user has only one 'friend' in his ego network? This task is more about machine-learning: it's a binary classification problem. You need to compose features set, form training and test samples from your data with both right and wrong predictions. Creating appropriate classifier will help you to filter out unpredictable users. But you need to determine, what are your features set. I used a number of network metrics, and summary statistics on feature of interest distribution among ego-network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This approach wouldn't populate all the gaps, but only predictable ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="941" LastActivityDate="2014-06-27T07:06:14.297" CommentCount="0" />

I would suggest to start with a basic validation approach for finding out lambda, whether you are doing batch or per-item learning. This is the easiest and safest approach. Try manually with a number of different values. e.g. 0.001. 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 etc. and see how your validation set behaves. Later on you may automate this process by introducing a linear or local search method. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I believe the value of lambda should be considered in relation to the updates of the parameter vector, rather than the training set size.

This is done by training a denoising auto encoder on the data you have (neglecting missing values in the reconstruction loss). Say you have a reconstruction function f and a input x. Then you will reconstruct it via x' = f(x). You then reset the values of x' with those you know from x. (I.e. you only keep the values that were missing before reconstruction.) If you do so many times, you are guaranteed to sample from the distribution given the values you know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in either case, these methods require quite some knowledge about statistics and neural nets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1193" LastActivityDate="2014-06-27T19:18:11.433" CommentCount="0" />

In most basic terms, it acts as a layer interfacing between the virtual OS, and your own OS which then communicates with the lower level hardware to provide support to the virtual OS. What this means for you is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Cons&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Hardware Support&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A drawback of virtual machine technology is that it supports only the hardware that both the virtual machine hypervisor and the guest operating system support. Even if the guest operating system supports the physical hardware, it sees only the virtual hardware presented by the virtual machine. &#xA;The second aspect of virtual machine hardware support is the hardware presented to the guest operating system. No matter the hardware in the host, the hardware presented to the guest environment is usually the same (with the exception of the CPU, which shows through). For example, VMware GSX Server presents an AMD PCnet32 Fast Ethernet card or an optimized VMware-proprietary network card, depending on which you choose. The network card in the host machine does not matter. VMware GSX Server performs the translation between the guest environment's network card and the host environment's network card. This is great for standardization, but it also means that host hardware that VMware does not understand will not be present in the guest environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Performance Penalty&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virtual machine technology imposes a performance penalty from running an additional layer above the physical hardware but beneath the guest operating system. The performance penalty varies based on the virtualization software used and the guest software being run. This is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Pros&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons to employ virtualization is to isolate applications from each other. Running everything on one machine would be great if it all worked, but many times it results in undesirable interactions or even outright conflicts. The cause often is software problems or business requirements, such as the need for isolated security. Virtual machines allow you to isolate each application (or group of applications) in its own sandbox environment. The virtual machines can run on the same physical machine (simplifying IT hardware management), yet appear as independent machines to the software you are running. For all intents and purposes—except performance, the virtual machines are independent machines. If one virtual machine goes down due to application or operating system error, the others continue running, providing services your business needs to function smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Standardization&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Another key benefit virtual machines provide is standardization. The hardware that is presented to the guest operating system is uniform for the most part, usually with the CPU being the only component that is &quot;pass-through&quot; in the sense that the guest sees what is on the host. A standardized hardware platform reduces support costs and increases the share of IT resources that you can devote to accomplishing goals that give your business a competitive advantage. The host machines can be different (as indeed they often are when hardware is acquired at different times), but the virtual machines will appear to be the same across all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ease of Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Virtual machines let you test scenarios easily. Most virtual machine software today provides snapshot and rollback capabilities. This means you can stop a virtual machine, create a snapshot, perform more operations in the virtual machine, and then roll back again and again until you have finished your testing. This is very handy for software development, but it is also useful for system administration. Admins can snapshot a system and install some software or make some configuration changes that they suspect may destabilize the system. If the software installs or changes work, then the admin can commit the updates. If the updates damage or destroy the system, the admin can roll them back.&#xA;  Virtual machines also facilitate scenario testing by enabling virtual networks. In VMware Workstation, for example, you can set up multiple virtual machines on a virtual network with configurable parameters, such as packet loss from congestion and latency. You can thus test timing-sensitive or load-sensitive applications to see how they perform under the stress of a simulated heavy workload.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Mobility&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Virtual machines are easy to move between physical machines. Most of the virtual machine software on the market today stores a whole disk in the guest environment as a single file in the host environment. Snapshot and rollback capabilities are implemented by storing the change in state in a separate file in the host information. Having a single file represent an entire guest environment disk promotes the mobility of virtual machines. Transferring the virtual machine to another physical machine is as easy as moving the virtual disk file and some configuration files to the other physical machine. Deploying another copy of a virtual machine is the same as transferring a virtual machine, except that instead of moving the files, you copy them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Which VM should I use if I am starting out?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Data Science Box or the Data Science Toolbox are your best bets if you just getting into data science. They have the basic software that you will need, with the primary difference being the virtual environment in which each of these can run. The DSB can run on AWS while the DST can run on Virtual Box (which is the most common tool used for VMs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Sources&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.devx.com/vmspecialreport/Article/30383&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/12/07/lean-mean-data-science-machine.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2014-06-30T01:51:11.027" CommentCount="1" />

You can adapt this strategy and instead of creating a wordcloud, you can create a frequency matrix of terms used.  The idea is to take the unstructured text and structure it somehow.  You change everything to lowercase (or uppercase), remove stop words, and find frequent terms for each job function, via Document Term Matrices.  You also have the option of stemming the words.  If you stem words you will be able to detect different forms of words as the same word.  For example, 'programed' and 'programming' could be stemmed to 'program'.  You can possibly add the occurrence of these frequent terms as a weighted feature in your ML model training.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also adapt this to frequent phrases, finding common groups of 2-3 words for each job function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Load libraries and build the example data&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tm)&#xA;library(SnowballC)&#xA;&#xA;doc1 = &quot;I am highly skilled in Java Programming.

You can keep only specific (more common) words and use them as features in your model.  Another way is to keep it simple and have a percentage of words used in each job description, say &quot;java&quot; would have 80% occurrence in 'software engineer' and only 50% occurrence in 'quality assurance'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to go look up why 'assurance' has 1 'r' and 'occurrence' has 2 'r's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="375" LastEditorUserId="375" LastEditDate="2014-07-03T22:52:29.253" LastActivityDate="2014-07-03T22:52:29.253" CommentCount="2" />

I guess, resumes can be treated as semi-structured documents. Sometimes, it's beneficial to have some minimal structure in the documents. I believe, in resumes you would see some tabular data. You might want to treat these as attribute value pairs. For example, you would get a list of terms for the attribute &quot;Skill set&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key idea is to manually configure a list of key phrases such as &quot;skill&quot;, &quot;education&quot;, &quot;publication&quot; etc. The next step is to extract terms which pertain to these key phrases either by exploiting the structure in some way (such as tables) or by utilizing the proximity of terms around these key phrases, e.g. the fact that the word &quot;Java&quot; is in close proximity to the term &quot;skill&quot; might indicate that the person is skilled in Java.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After you extract these information, the next step could be to build up a feature vector for each of these key phrases. You can then represent a document as a vector with different fields (one each for a key phrase). For example, consider the following two resumes represented with two fields, namely &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;education&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doc1: {project: (java, 3) (c, 4)}, {education: (computer, 2), (physics, 1)}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doc2: {project: (java, 3) (python, 2)}, {education: (maths, 3), (computer, 2)}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, I show a term with the frequency. Of course, while extracting the terms you need to stem and remove stop-words. It is clear from the examples that the person whose resume is Doc1 is more skilled in C than that of D2. Implementation wise, it's very easy to represent documents as field vectors in Lucene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the next step is to retrieve a ranked list of resumes given a job specification. In fact, that's fairly straight forward if you represent queries (job specs) as field vectors as well. You just need to retrieve a ranked list of candidates (resumes) using Lucene from a collection of indexed resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="984" LastActivityDate="2014-07-03T20:47:20.147" CommentCount="6" />

Gensim's implementations are very fast however, as it uses iterative SVD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other note, if you use word2vec, you will still have to determine a way to compose vectors from documents, as it gives you a different vector per word. The simplest way to do this is to normalize each vector and take the mean over all word vectors in the document, or take a weighted mean by idf weighting of each word. So it's not as simple as 'use word2vec', you will need to do something further to compute document similarity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would personally go with LSA, as I have seen it work well empirically, and gensim's library scales very well.

All other points from the training set needn't be stored in memory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The so-called power of kernels: With appropriate kernels you can transform feature space into a higher dimension so that it becomes linearly separable.

Firstly, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apriori&lt;/a&gt; algorithm was proposed in 1993, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=170072&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Agrawal et al.&lt;/a&gt;, along with the formalization of the problem. The algorithm was able to &lt;em&gt;strip-off&lt;/em&gt; some sets from the &lt;code&gt;2^n - 1&lt;/code&gt; sets (powerset) by using a lattice to maintain the data. A drawback of the approach was the need to re-read the database to compute the frequency of each set expanded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, on year 1997, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tk/2000/03/k0372-abs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zaki et al.&lt;/a&gt; proposed the algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_Eclat_Algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eclat&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;inserted&lt;/em&gt; the resulting frequency of each set inside the lattice. This was done by adding, at each node of the lattice, the set of transaction-ids that had the items from root to the referred node. The main contribution is that one does not have to re-read the entire dataset to know the frequency of each set, but the memory required to keep such data structure built may exceed the size of the dataset itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=335191.335372&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Han et al.&lt;/a&gt; proposed an algorithm named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Mining_Algorithms_In_R/Frequent_Pattern_Mining/The_FP-Growth_Algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FPGrowth&lt;/a&gt;, along with a prefix-tree data structure named FPTree. The algorithm was able to provide significant data compression, while also granting that only frequent itemsets would be yielded (without candidate itemset generation). This was done mainly by sorting the items of each transaction in decreasing order, so that the most frequent items are the ones with the least repetitions in the tree data structure. Since the frequency only descends while traversing the tree in-depth, the algorithm is able to &lt;em&gt;strip-off&lt;/em&gt; non-frequent itemsets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;As far as I know, this may be considered a state-of-the-art algorithm, but I'd like to know about other proposed solutions.

If you commit those changes back to SVN, then on your local machine you will have the remote paths, and on and on ...  (What if there are not only paths, but also passwords?  You should not have production passwords in an SVN server.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, keep paths and other setup informations in a &lt;code&gt;.ini&lt;/code&gt; file and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ConfigParser&lt;/a&gt; to read it, or use a &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; file and use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;json&lt;/a&gt; module.

Tools that help in report generation and presentation is also a large category, where &lt;code&gt;Sweave&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; are probably the most well-known ones. &lt;code&gt;Sweave&lt;/code&gt; is a tool, focused on R, but it can be integrated with Python-based projects, albeit with some additional effort (&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161152/sweave-for-python&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161152/sweave-for-python&lt;/a&gt;). I think that &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; might be a better option, as it's modern, has extensive support by popular tools (such as &lt;code&gt;RStudio&lt;/code&gt;) and is language-neutral (&lt;a href=&quot;http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines&quot;&gt;http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Protocol and suggested directory structure&lt;/strong&gt;. If I understood correctly what you implied by using term &lt;em&gt;protocol&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;workflow&lt;/em&gt;), generally I think that standard RR data analysis workflow consists of the following sequential phases: &lt;em&gt;data collection&lt;/em&gt; =&gt; &lt;em&gt;data preparation&lt;/em&gt; (cleaning, transformation, merging, sampling) =&gt; &lt;em&gt;data analysis&lt;/em&gt; =&gt; &lt;em&gt;presentation of results&lt;/em&gt; (generating reports and/or presentations). Nevertheless, every workflow is project-specific and, thus, some specific tasks might require adding additional steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For sample directory structure, you may take a look at documentation for R package &lt;code&gt;ProjectTemplate&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://projecttemplate.net&quot;&gt;http://projecttemplate.net&lt;/a&gt;), as an attempt to automate data analysis workflows and projects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/0B2vo.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Automated build/run tools&lt;/strong&gt;. Since my answer is focused on universal (language-neutral) RR tools, the most popular tools is &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. Read the following article for some reasons to use &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; as the preferred RR workflow automation tool: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make&quot;&gt;http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly, there are other &lt;strong&gt;similar&lt;/strong&gt; tools, which either improve some aspects of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, or add some additional features. For example: &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt; (officially, Apache Ant: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ant.apache.org&quot;&gt;http://ant.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;Maven&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;next generation &lt;code&gt;ant&lt;/code&gt;&quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org&quot;&gt;http://maven.apache.org&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rake&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ruby/rake&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;Makepp&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://makepp.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;http://makepp.sourceforge.net&lt;/a&gt;).

And in general, all the other good things that software engineering has created along decades for ensuring isolation and reproductibility. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to stress that it is not enough to have &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; reproducible workflows, but also &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to reproduce workflows. Let me show what I mean. Suppose that your project uses Python, a database X and Scipy. Most surely you will be using a specific library to connect to your database from Python, and Scipy will be in turn using some sparse algebraic routines. This is by all means a very simple setup, but not entirely simple to setup, pun intended. If somebody wants to execute your scripts, she will have to install all the dependencies. Or worse, she might have incompatible versions of it already installed. Fixing those things takes time. It will also take time to you if you at some moment need to move your computations to a cluster, to a different cluster, or to some cloud servers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is where I find docker useful. Docker is a way to formalize and compile recipes for binary environments. You can write the following in a dockerfile (I'm using here plain English instead of the Dockerfile syntax):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with a basic binary environment, like Ubuntu's&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install libsparse-dev&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Pip) Install numpy and scipy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install X&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install libX-dev&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Pip) Install python-X&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Install IPython-Notebook&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Copy my python scripts/notebooks to my binary environment, these datafiles, and these configurations to do other miscellaneous things. To ensure reproductibility, copy them from a named url instead of a local file. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maybe run IPython-Notebook.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the lines will be installing things in Python using pip, since pip can do a very clean work in selecting specific package versions. Check it out too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that's it. If after you create your Dockerfile it can be built, then it can be built anywhere, by anybody (provided they also have access to your project-specific files, e.g. because you put them in a public url referenced from the Dockerfile). What is best, you can upload the resulting environment (called an &quot;image&quot;) to a public or private server (called a &quot;register&quot;) for other people to use. So, when you publish your workflow, you have both a fully reproducible recipe in the form of a Dockerfile, and an easy way for you or other people to reproduce what you do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or if they want to poke around in your scripts and so forth:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -i -t dockerregistery.thewheezylab.org/nowyouwillbelieveme /bin/bash&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2575" LastActivityDate="2014-07-18T07:43:56.823" CommentCount="0" />

I would like to join the discussion by adding the following two &lt;strong&gt;notes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) The question's emphasis on the &lt;strong&gt;volume of data&lt;/strong&gt; while referring to &lt;em&gt;Big Data&lt;/em&gt; is certainly understandable and valid, especially considering the &lt;strong&gt;problem&lt;/strong&gt; of data volume growth &lt;strong&gt;outpacing&lt;/strong&gt; technological capacities' exponential growth per &lt;em&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Having said that, it is important to remember about other aspects of big data concept, based on &lt;em&gt;Gartner&lt;/em&gt;'s definition (emphasis mine - AB): &quot;&lt;em&gt;Big data&lt;/em&gt; is high &lt;strong&gt;volume&lt;/strong&gt;, high &lt;strong&gt;velocity&lt;/strong&gt;, and/or high &lt;strong&gt;variety&lt;/strong&gt; information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization.&quot; (usually referred to as the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;3Vs model&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;). I mention this, because it forces data scientists and other analysts to look for and use R packages that focus on &lt;strong&gt;other than volume&lt;/strong&gt; aspects of big data (enabled by the &lt;strong&gt;richness&lt;/strong&gt; of enormous &lt;em&gt;R ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) While existing answers mention some R packages, related to big data, for a more &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive coverage&lt;/strong&gt;, I'd recommend to refer to &lt;em&gt;CRAN Task View&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&quot;High-Performance and Parallel Computing with R&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html&lt;/a&gt;), in particular, sections &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Parallel computing: Hadoop&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Large memory and out-of-memory data&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2452" LastActivityDate="2014-07-19T02:19:46.530" CommentCount="0" />

First though, let's talk about exactly what &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; is. Honestly, for being one of the most widely used efficacy metrics, it's surprisingly obtuse to figure out exactly how &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; stands for &lt;code&gt;Area Under the Curve&lt;/code&gt;, which curve you ask? Well that would be the &lt;code&gt;ROC&lt;/code&gt; curve. &lt;code&gt;ROC&lt;/code&gt; stands for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic&quot;&gt;Receiver Operating Characteristic&lt;/a&gt;, which is actually slightly non-intuitive. The implicit goal of &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; is to deal with situations where you have a very skewed sample distribution, and don't want to overfit to a single class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great example is in spam detection. Generally spam data sets are STRONGLY biased towards ham, or not-spam. If your data set is 90% ham, you can get a pretty damn good accuracy by just saying that every single email is ham, which is obviously something that indicates a non-ideal classifier. Let's start with a couple of metrics that are a little more useful for us, specifically the true positive rate (&lt;code&gt;TPR&lt;/code&gt;) and the false positive rate (&lt;code&gt;FPR&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/hNxTl.png&quot; alt=&quot;ROC axes&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now in this graph, &lt;code&gt;TPR&lt;/code&gt; is specifically the ratio of true positive to all positives, and &lt;code&gt;FPR&lt;/code&gt; is the ratio of false positives to all negatives. (Keep in mind, this is only for binary classification.) On a graph like this, it should be pretty straightforward to figure out that a prediction of all 0's or all 1's will result in the points of &lt;code&gt;(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(1,1)&lt;/code&gt; respectively. If you draw a line through these lines you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/B1WT1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kind of like a triangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which looks basically like a diagonal line (it is), and by some easy geometry, you can see that the &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; of such a model would be &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; (height and base are both 1). Similarly, if you predict a random assortment of 0's and 1's, let's say 90% 1's, you could get the point &lt;code&gt;(0.9, 0.9)&lt;/code&gt;, which again falls along that diagonal line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now comes the interesting part. What if we weren't only predicting 0's and 1's? What if instead we wanted to say that, theoretically we were going to set a cutoff, above which every result was a 1, and below which every result were a 0. This would mean that at the extremes you get the original situation where you have all 0's and all 1's (at a cutoff of 0 and 1 respectively), but also a series of intermediate states that fall within the &lt;code&gt;1x1&lt;/code&gt; graph that contains your &lt;code&gt;ROC&lt;/code&gt;. In practice you get something like this:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/13McM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Courtesy of Wikipedia&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically, what you're actually getting when you do an &lt;code&gt;AUC&lt;/code&gt; over accuracy is something that will strongly discourage people going for models that are representative, but not discriminative, as this will only actually select for models that achieve false positive and true positive rates that are significantly above random chance, which is not guaranteed for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="548" LastActivityDate="2014-07-22T04:10:18.353" CommentCount="2" />

For basic analytics and reporting statistics will certainly help, but for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence then you'll want a few more skills&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probability theory&lt;/strong&gt; - you must have a solid background in pure probability so that you can decompose any problem, whether seen before or not, into probabilistic principles.  Statistics helps a lot for already solved problems, but new and unsolved problems require a deep understanding of probability so that you can design appropriate techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Theory&lt;/strong&gt; - this (relative to statistics) is quite a new field (though still decades old), the most important work was by Shannon, but even more important and often neglected note in literature is work by Hobson that proved that Kullback-Leibler Divergence is the only mathematical definition that truly captures the notion of a &lt;em&gt;&quot;measure of information&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Now fundamental to artificial intellgence is being able to quantify information.  Suggest reading &quot;Concepts in Statistical Mechanics&quot; - Arthur Hobson (very expensive book, only available in academic libraries).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity Theory&lt;/strong&gt; - A big problem many Data Scientists face that do not have a solid complexity theory background is that their algorithms do not scale, or just take an extremely long time to run on large data.  Take PCA for example, many peoples favourite answer to the interview question &quot;how do you reduce the number of features in our dataset&quot;, but even if you tell the candidate &quot;the data set is really really really large&quot; they still propose various forms of PCA that are O(n^3).  If you want to stand out, you want to be able to solve each problem on it's own, NOT throw some text book solution at it designed a long time ago before Big Data was such a hip thing.  For that you need to understand how long things take to run, not only theoretically, but practically - so how to use a cluster of computers to distribute an algorithm, or which data structures take up less memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Skills&lt;/strong&gt; - A huge part of Data Science is understanding business.  Whether it's inventing a product driven by data science, or giving business insight driven by data science, being able to communicate well with both the Project and Product Managers, the tech teams, and your fellow data scientists is very important.  You can have an amazing idea, say an awesome AI solution, but if you cannot effectively (a) communicate WHY that will make the business money, (b) convince your collegues it will work and (c) explain to tech people how you need their help to build it, then it wont get done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2668" LastActivityDate="2014-07-22T21:12:08.333" CommentCount="0" />

That commonly happens by random chance.  To a certain degree this can be taken care of by covariate adjusted randomization.  It can also be taken care of by adding covariates to the model that tests the effect of the design decision.  It should be noted that there is still some discussion about the proper way to do this within the statistics community.

There's one subtlety, though - job titles are too short to carry important context. Let me explain this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine LinkedIn profiles (which is pretty good source for data). Normally, they contain 4-10 sentences describing person's skills and qualifications. It's pretty likely that you find phrases like &quot;lead data scientist&quot; and &quot;professional knowledge of Matlab and R&quot; in a same profile, but it's very unlikely to also see &quot;junior Java developer&quot; in it. So we may say that &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; (as well as &quot;data scientist&quot; and &quot;Matlab&quot; and &quot;R&quot;) often occur in same contexts, but they are rarely found together with &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;Java&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Co-occurrence matrix shows exactly this. The more 2 words occur in same context, the more similar their vectors in the matrix will look like. And cosine distance is just a good way to measure this similarity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about job titles? Normally they are much shorter and don't actually create enough context to catch similarities. Luckily, you don't need source data to be titles themselves - you need to find similarities between skills in general, not specifically in titles. So you can simply build co-occurrence matrix from (long) profiles and then use it to measure similarity of titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt; - in fact, it's already worked for me on a similar project. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T15:46:48.977" CommentCount="0" />

Consider following example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rdd = sc.parallelize(range(5))&#xA;rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x + 1)&#xA;rdd.collect()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you have distributed collection and lambda function to send to all workers. Lambda is completely self-containing, so it's easy to copy its binary representation to other nodes without any worries. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's make things a bit more interesting: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f = open(&quot;/etc/hosts&quot;)&#xA;rdd = sc.parallelize(range(100))&#xA;rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: f.read())&#xA;rdd.collect()&#xA;f.close()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boom!

Without actual data and knowing record format, I cannot debug it completely, but I guess that problem goes from this line: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def vectorizer(text, vocab=vocab_dict):&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Python, keyword arguments are initialized when function is called for the first time.

Thus function is called with fewer parameters than it expects which results in &lt;code&gt;__init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)&lt;/code&gt; error. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note, that you follow very bad pattern of  &lt;code&gt;sc.parallelize(...)...collect()&lt;/code&gt; calls. First you spread your collection to entire cluster, do some computations, and then pull the result. But sending data back and forth is pretty pointless here. Instead, you can just do these computations locally, and run Spark's parallel processes only when you work with really big datasets (like you main &lt;code&gt;amazon_dataset&lt;/code&gt;, I guess).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-07-26T00:11:03.637" CommentCount="1" />

It uses machine learning, statistics and other fields to simplify (or even automate) decision making. Data science techniques may work with any data size, but more data means better predictions and thus more precise decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadoop&lt;/strong&gt; is a common name for a set of tools intended to work with large amounts of data. Two most important components in Hadoop are HDFS and MapReduce.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDFS&lt;/strong&gt;, or Hadoop Distributed File System, is a special distributed storage capable of holding really large data amounts. Large files on HDFS are split into blocks, and for each block HDFS API exposes its &lt;em&gt;location&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MapReduce&lt;/strong&gt; is framework for running computations on nodes with data. MapReduce heavily uses &lt;em&gt;data locality&lt;/em&gt; exposed by HDFS: when possible, data is not transferred between nodes, but instead code is copied to the nodes with data. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically any problem (including data science tasks) that doesn't break data locality principle may be efficiently implemented using MapReduce (and a number of other problems may be solved not that efficiently, but still simply enough).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's take some examples. Very often analyst only needs some simple statistics over his tabular data. In this case &lt;a href=&quot;https://hive.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically SQL engine over MapReduce, works pretty well (there are also Impala, Shark and others, but they don't use Hadoop's MapReduce, so more on them later). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other cases analyst (or developer) may want to work with previously unstructured data. Pure MapReduce is pretty good for &lt;strong&gt;transforming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;standardizing&lt;/strong&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people are used to exploratory statistics and visualization using tools like R. It's possible to apply this approach to big data amounts using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHadoop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to MapReduce-based machine learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://mahout.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Mahout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first to mention. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's, however, one type of algorithms that work pretty slowly on Hadoop even in presence of data locality, namely, iterative algorithms. Iterative algorithms tend to have multiple Map and Reduce stages. Hadoop's MR framework &lt;strong&gt;reads&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;writes&lt;/strong&gt; data to disk on each stage (and sometimes in between), which makes iterative (as well as any multi-stage) tasks terribly slow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are alternative frameworks that can both - use data locality and keep data in memory between stages. Probably, the most notable of them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spark is complete replacement for Hadoop's MapReduce that uses its own runtime and exposes pretty rich API for manipulating your distributed dataset. Spark has several sub-projects, closely related to data science: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shark.cs.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/sql/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  provide alternative SQL-like interfaces to data stored on HDFS&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/streaming/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark Streaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to work with continuous data streams (e.g. Twitter feed)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/mllib/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MLlib&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; implements a number of machine learning algorithms with a pretty simple and flexible API&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/graphx/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enables large-scale graph processing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there's pretty large set of data science problems that you can solve with Hadoop and related projects. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastActivityDate="2014-07-29T13:43:39.060" CommentCount="4" />

To be more precise, it works best when the result can be found from the result of some function of a partition of the input. Averaging is a trivial example; you can do this with map/reduce by summing each partition, returning the sum and the number of elements in the partition, then computing the overall mean using these intermediate results. It is less appropriate when the intermediate steps depend on the state of the other partitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="381" LastActivityDate="2014-07-30T07:49:14.467" CommentCount="0" />

The use-case I've got is a &quot;recommendation engine&quot; for movies a user has watched. Movies have lots of string data (title, plot, tags), and I could imagine &quot;downsampling&quot; the text down to a few key words that describe that movie, but even if I parse out the top five words that describe this movie, I think I'd need input neurons for every english word in order to compare a set of movies? I could limit the input neurons just to the words used in the set, but then could it grow/learn by adding new movies (user watches a new movie, with new words)? Most of the libraries I've seen don't allow adding new neurons after the system has been trained?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a standard way to map string/word/character data to inputs into a neural network?

In other words, you have a vector of length n, where n is the number of words in your vocabulary, and each word corresponds to an element in the vector.  In order to convert text to numeric data, you simply count the number of occurrences of each word and place that value at the index of the vector that corresponds to the word. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model.&quot;&gt;Wikipedia does an excellent job of describing this conversion process.&lt;/a&gt;  Because the length of the vector is fixed, its difficult to deal with new words that don't map to an index, but there are ways to help mitigate this problem (lookup &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing&quot;&gt;feature hashing&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method of representation has many disadvantages -- it does not preserve the relationship between adjacent words, and results in very sparse vectors.  Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram&quot;&gt;n-grams&lt;/a&gt; helps to fix the problem of preserving word relationships, but for now let's focus on the second problem: sparsity.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to deal directly with these sparse vectors (many linear algebra libraries do a poor job of handling sparse inputs), so often the next step is dimensionality reduction. For that we can refer to the field of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model&quot;&gt;topic modeling&lt;/a&gt;:  Techniques like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation&quot;&gt;Latent Dirichlet Allocation&lt;/a&gt; (LDA) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis&quot;&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/a&gt; (LSA) allow the compression of these sparse vectors into dense vectors by representing a document as a combination of topics.  You can fix the number of topics used, and in doing so fix the size of the output vector producted by LDA or LSA. This dimensionality reduction process drastically reduces the size of the input vector while attempting to lose a minimal amount of information.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, after all of these conversions, you can feed the outputs of the topic modeling process into the inputs of your neural network.     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="684" LastActivityDate="2014-07-30T17:53:40.330" CommentCount="3" />

With &lt;strong&gt;Learning Curve&lt;/strong&gt;, you can evaluate your experiments &lt;em&gt;learning ability&lt;/em&gt;. To talk a bit more, you will &lt;strong&gt;fix&lt;/strong&gt; commodity configuration, and then will run same experiment on the same number of machines with different size of data set you have (from starting from small chunk in size, incrementally increase the size until you reach the whole data set). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To point on, you should avoid having &lt;em&gt;power distribution&lt;/em&gt; for result of performance test being run with different size of data sets. To avoid, you should carefully choose &lt;em&gt;step size&lt;/em&gt; (step size = amount of increments).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have about ten machines available, each with 200 GB of free space on hard disk. However, I would like to perform experiments on a greater number of nodes, to measure scalability more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this type question, I have intuitively searched and read materials; afterwards, published as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/scale-your-vision&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the post, I have briefly talked about how to test your hypothesis on real complex system. If you let me, I want to briefly talk about;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;base requirement&lt;/strong&gt; should be formed in order to run data set as a whole. The minimum requirement will build your &lt;strong&gt;baseline evaluation score&lt;/strong&gt; which is calculated with one/combination of evaluation metrics you have chosen, or with one/combination of methods being used to calculate &lt;code&gt;Running Time = Computation complexity + Communication cost + Synchronization cost&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After those steps, with an &lt;em&gt;evaluation strategy&lt;/em&gt;, add new elements, e.g. new node, to the system you have doing scalability test; meanwhile, for each addition, measure performance w.r.t new system configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to note, &lt;em&gt;evaluation strategy&lt;/em&gt; must be planned along with considerations of default behavior of parallel and distributed systems. For example, what I mean by behavior is that adding just more cores will, after some point, automatically drop performance of the system not due to your algorithm characteristics. It is because more cores need more RAMs, more hard driver, or etc. In other words, there is a &lt;strong&gt;N-Way&lt;/strong&gt; relationship between hardware components.

Different models, such as random forests, regression, etc. could capture only part of relations and ignore others. In such circumstances it makes sense to use general &lt;strong&gt;statistical exploration&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;modelling&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the very first thing I would do is finding out &lt;strong&gt;correlations&lt;/strong&gt; between possible precursor conditions and diagnoses. E.g. in what percent of cases chronic kidney disease was preceded by long flu? If it is high, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;doesn't always mean causality&lt;/a&gt;, but gives pretty good food for thought and helps to better understand relations between different conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important step is data visualisation. Does CKD happens in males more often than in females? What about their place of residence? What is distribution of CKD cases by age? It's hard to grasp large dataset as a set of numbers, plotting them out makes it much easier. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you have an idea of what's going on, perform &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hypothesis testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to check your assumption. If you reject null hypothesis (basic assumption) in favour of alternative one, congratulations, you've made &quot;something real&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you have a good understanding of your data, try to create complete &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt;.

Therefore, I think that you can solve this issue in at least several ways, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Convert data&lt;/strong&gt; to correct type &lt;strong&gt;during import&lt;/strong&gt;. To do this, just use the following options of &lt;code&gt;read.csv()&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;stringsAsFactors&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;as.is&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;colClasses&lt;/code&gt;.

First, if you have a single Date column, you can use &lt;code&gt;as.Date.character()&lt;/code&gt; to pass the desired format to &lt;code&gt;colClasses&lt;/code&gt;. Second, if you have multiple Date columns, you can write a function for that and pass it to &lt;code&gt;colClasses&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;setAs()&lt;/code&gt;.

  <row Id="913" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="902" CreationDate="2014-08-05T12:58:16.000" Score="3" Body="&lt;p&gt;There are two rules for generalizability:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample must be &lt;strong&gt;representative&lt;/strong&gt;. In expectation, at least, the distribution of features in your sample must match the distribution of features in the population. When you are fitting a model with a response variable, &lt;em&gt;this includes features that you do not observe, but that affect any response variables in your model&lt;/em&gt;. Since it is, in many cases, impossible to know what you do not observe, &lt;strong&gt;random sampling&lt;/strong&gt; is used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea with randomization is that a random sample, up to sampling error, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; accurately reflect the distribution of all features in the population, observed and otherwise. This is why &lt;strong&gt;randomization is the &quot;gold standard,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; but if sample control is available by some other technique, or it is defensible to argue that there are no omitted features, then it isn't always necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sample must be &lt;strong&gt;large enough&lt;/strong&gt; that the effect of &lt;strong&gt;sampling error&lt;/strong&gt; on the feature distribution is relatively small. This is, again, to ensure representativeness. But deciding who to sample is different from deciding how many people to sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it sounds like you're fitting a model, there's the additional consideration that certain important combinations of features could be relatively rare in the population. This is not an issue for generalizability, but it bears heavily on your considerations for sample size. For instance, I'm working on a project now with (non-big) data that was originally collected to understand the experiences of minorities in college. As such, it was critically important to ensure that &lt;strong&gt;statistical power&lt;/strong&gt; was high &lt;em&gt;specifically in the minority subpopulation&lt;/em&gt;. For this reason, blacks and Latinos were deliberately &lt;strong&gt;oversampled&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the proportion by which they were oversampled was also recorded. These are used to compute survey weights. These can be used to  re-weight the sample so as to reflect the estimated population proportions, in the event that a representative sample is required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An additional consideration arises if your model is hierarchical. A canonical use for a hierarchical model is one of children's behavior in schools. Children are &quot;grouped&quot; by school and share school-level traits. Therefore a representative sample of schools is required, and within each school a representative sample of children is required. This leads to &lt;strong&gt;stratified sampling&lt;/strong&gt;. This and some other sampling designs are reviewed in surprising depth on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1156" LastActivityDate="2014-08-05T12:58:16.000" CommentCount="1" />

You can run such a regression using R without any special efforts for sparse data. Just use the &lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt; command (for &quot;linear model&quot;). Use &lt;code&gt;?lm&lt;/code&gt; to see the help page. And note that &lt;code&gt;lm&lt;/code&gt; will by default silently add a constant column of ones to your design matrix (the intercept) - include a &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; on the right hand side of your formula to suppress this. Overall, assuming all your data (and nothing else) is in a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;model &amp;lt;- lm(y~.-1,data=foo)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then you can look at parameter estimates etc. like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(model)&#xA;residuals(model)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; your system is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; larger, say on the order of 10,000 observations and hundreds of predictors, looking at specialized sparse solvers as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853&quot;&gt;Aleksandr's answer&lt;/a&gt; may start to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in your comment to &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/918/2853&quot;&gt;Aleksandr's answer&lt;/a&gt;, you mention constraints on your equation.

In Java an exception can have several causing exceptions, and the whole must be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, given the following example exception:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.myapp.CustomException: Error printing ...&#xA;... (stack)&#xA;Caused by: com.foo.webservice.RemoteException: Unable to communicate ...&#xA;... (stack)&#xA;Caused by: com.acme.PrintException: PrintServer002: Timeout ....&#xA;... (stack)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, our algorithm splits the whole stack in three isolated exceptions. Afterwards it starts analyzing these exceptions starting from the most inner one. In this case, it determines that this exception (the second caused by) is of type &lt;code&gt;Availability&lt;/code&gt; and that the responsible component is a &quot;print server&quot;. This is because there is a rule that matches containing the word &lt;code&gt;Timeout&lt;/code&gt; associated to the &lt;code&gt;Availability&lt;/code&gt; type. There is also a rule that matches &lt;code&gt;com.acme.PrintException&lt;/code&gt; and determines that the responsible component is a print server. As all the information needed is determined using only the most inner exception, the upper exceptions are ignored, but this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see this kind of approximation is very complex (and chaotic) as a human have to create new rules as new exceptions appear. Besides, the new rules have to be compatible with the current ones because a new rule for classifying a new exception must not change the classification of any of the already classified exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are thinking about using Machine Learning to automate this process.

Predicted variable is just what you want to know, i.e. in your case it is exception type. Features are more tricky. You cannot just throw raw text into an algorithm, you need to extract meaningful parts of it and organize them as feature vectors first. You've already mentioned a couple of useful features - exception class name (e.g. &lt;code&gt;com.acme.PrintException&lt;/code&gt;) and contained words (&quot;Timeout&quot;). All you need is to translate your row exceptions (and human-categorized exception types) into suitable dataset, e.g.: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ex_class                  contains_timeout  ...   | ex_type&#xA;-----------------------------------------------------------&#xA;[com.acme.PrintException, 1                , ...] | Availability&#xA;[java.lang.Exception    , 0                , ...] | Network&#xA; ...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This representation is already much better for ML algorithms. But which one to take? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking into account nature of the task and your current approach natural choice is to use &lt;strong&gt;decision trees&lt;/strong&gt;. This class of algorithms will compute optimal decision criteria for all your exception types and print out resulting tree. This is especially useful, because you will have possibility to manually inspect how decision is made and see how much it corresponds to your manually-crafted rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's, however, possibility that some exceptions with exactly the same features will belong to different exception types. In this case probabilistic approach may work well. Despite its name, &lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes&lt;/strong&gt; classifier works pretty well in most cases. There's one issue with NB and our dataset representation, though: dataset contains &lt;em&gt;categorical&lt;/em&gt; variables, and Naive Bayes can work with &lt;em&gt;numerical&lt;/em&gt; attributes only*. Standard way to overcome this problem is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_%28statistics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dummy variables&lt;/a&gt;. In short, dummy variables are binary variables that simply indicate whether specific category presents or not. For example, single variable &lt;code&gt;ex_class&lt;/code&gt; with values &lt;code&gt;{com.acme.PrintException, java.lang.Exception, ...}&lt;/code&gt;, etc. may be split into several variables &lt;code&gt;ex_class_printexception&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ex_class_exception&lt;/code&gt;, etc. with values &lt;code&gt;{0, 1}&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ex_class_printexception  ex_class_exception  contains_timeout | ex_type&#xA;-----------------------------------------------------------------------&#xA;[1,                    , 0                 , 1              ] | Availability&#xA;[0,                    , 1                 , 0              ] | Network&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One last algorithm to try is &lt;strong&gt;Support Vector Machines (SVM)&lt;/strong&gt;.

MongoDB is neither fast with this type of data, nor provide any advanced tools for analysis (correct me if you know any). So I can think of a very few applications for Mongo in data mining. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadoop&lt;/strong&gt; is a large ecosystem, containing dozens of different tools. I will assume that you mean core Hadoop features - HDFS and MapReduce. HDFS provides flexible way to store large amounts of data, while MapReduce gives basis for processing them. It has its clear advantages for processing multi-terabyte datasets, but it also has significant drawbacks. In particular, because of intensive disk IO during MapReduce tasks (that slows down computations a lot) it is terrible for interactive development, iterative algorithms and working with not-that-big datasets. For more details see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/863/1279&quot;&gt;earlier answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many algorithms in Hadoop require multiple MapReduce jobs with complicated data flow. This is where &lt;strong&gt;Scalding&lt;/strong&gt; gets shiny. Scalding (and underlying Java's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cascading.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cascading&lt;/a&gt;) provides much simpler API, but at the moment uses same MapReduce as its runtime and thus holds all the same issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark&lt;/strong&gt; addresses exactly these issues. It drops Hadoop's MapReduce and offers completely new computational framework based on distributed in-memory collections and delayed evaluations. Its API is somewhat similar to Scalding's with all MR complexity removed, so it's really easy to get started with it. Spark is also the first in this list that comes with data mining library - &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MLlib&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Spark doesn't reinvent things like basic linear algebra. For this purpose it uses &lt;strong&gt;Breeze&lt;/strong&gt;. To my opinion, Breeze is far in quality from scientific packages like SciPy, Octave or Julia, but it is still good enough for most practical use cases. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahout&lt;/strong&gt; relies on Hadoop's MapReduce and thus is terrible for iterative algorithms. &lt;strong&gt;Spire&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Saddle&lt;/strong&gt; look cute and probably have their niche, but seem to be much less well-known than Breeze. I couldn't find much information about &lt;strong&gt;H2O&lt;/strong&gt;, so it doesn't look like a big player here (comments from people who used it are welcome).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some quick summary. Spark seems to be the most simple, flexible and fast-growing project for large-scale data processing. It facilitates a number of new projects (e.g. Shark or Spark SQL) and penetrates into existing (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.concurrentinc.com/2014/05/cascading-now-supports-tez-spark-and-storm-up-next/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cascading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mahout.apache.org/users/sparkbindings/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mahout&lt;/a&gt;). Spark knows how to utilize HDFS API, and thus scales to terabytes of data easily. And for data mining downshifters who don't want to bother with a cluster setup there's always pure Breeze. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1279" LastEditorUserId="1279" LastEditDate="2014-08-09T21:25:58.250" LastActivityDate="2014-08-09T21:25:58.250" CommentCount="0" />

For example when points are merged into a cluster then the identity of the cluster is determined by the majority.

Frequently computed distances are stored in a cache. If the cache is getting thrashed then the running time blows up to O(n_features x n_observations^3). (Seriously, no LaTeX?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can increase this cache by invoking SVR as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;model = SVR(cache_size=7000)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, this is not going to work. But all is not lost. You can subsample the data and use the rest as a validation set, or you can pick a different model. Above the 200,000 observation range, it's wise to choose linear learners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kernel SVM can be approximated, by approximating the kernel matrix and feeding it to a linear SVM. This allows you to trade off between accuracy and performance in linear time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A popular means of achieving this is to use 100 or so cluster centers found by kmeans/kmeans++ as the basis of your kernel function. The new derived features are then fed into a linear model. This works very well in practice. Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/sofia-ml/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sophia-ml&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vowpal wabbit&lt;/a&gt; are how Google, Yahoo and Microsoft do this.

You have to provide more details. If you're dealing with &lt;strong&gt;bid data&lt;/strong&gt;, then this fact will most likely affect selection of preferred &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;approaches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;algorithms&lt;/em&gt; for your &lt;strong&gt;data analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. I hope that the following thoughts of mine on data analysis address your sub-questions. Please note that the numbering of my points does not match the numbering of your sub-questions. However, I believe that it better reflects general &lt;strong&gt;data analysis workflow&lt;/strong&gt;, at least, how I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Firstly, I think that you need to have at least some kind of &lt;strong&gt;conceptual model&lt;/strong&gt; in mind (or, better, on paper). This model should guide you in your &lt;em&gt;exploratory data analysis (EDA)&lt;/em&gt;. A presence of a &lt;em&gt;dependent variable (DV)&lt;/em&gt; in the model means that in your &lt;em&gt;machine learning (ML)&lt;/em&gt; phase later in the analysis you will deal with so called supervised ML, as opposed to unsupervised ML in the absence of an identified DV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;EDA&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial part. IMHO, EDA should include &lt;strong&gt;multiple iterations&lt;/strong&gt; of producing &lt;em&gt;descriptive statistics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;data visualization&lt;/em&gt;, as you refine your understanding about the data. Not only this phase will give you valuable insights about your datasets, but it will feed your next important phase - &lt;strong&gt;data cleaning and transformation&lt;/strong&gt;. Just throwing your raw data into a statistical software package won't give much - for any &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt; statistical analysis, data should be &lt;em&gt;clean, correct and consistent&lt;/em&gt;. This is often the most time- and effort-consuming, but absolutely necessary part. For more details on this topic, read these nice papers: &lt;a href=&quot;http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (by Hadley Wickham) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Now, as you're hopefully done with &lt;em&gt;EDA&lt;/em&gt; as well as data cleaning and transformation, your ready to start some more statistically-involved phases. One of such phases is &lt;em&gt;exploratory factor analysis (EFA)&lt;/em&gt;, which will allow you to extract the underlying &lt;strong&gt;structure&lt;/strong&gt; of your data. For datasets with large number of variables, the positive side effect of EFA is &lt;em&gt;dimensionality reduction&lt;/em&gt;. And, while in that sense EFA is similar to &lt;em&gt;principal components analysis (PCA)&lt;/em&gt; and other dimensionality reduction approaches, I think that EFA is more important as it allows to refine your conceptual model of the phenomena that your data &quot;describe&quot;, thus making sense of your datasets. Of course, in addition to EFA, you can/should perform &lt;strong&gt;regression analysis&lt;/strong&gt; as well as apply &lt;strong&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/strong&gt;, based on your findings in previous phases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a note on &lt;strong&gt;software tools&lt;/strong&gt;. In my opinion, current state of statistical software packages is at such point that practically any major software packages have comparable offerings feature-wise. If you study or work in an organization that have certain policies and preferences in term of software tools, then you are &lt;em&gt;constrained&lt;/em&gt; by them. However, if that is not the case, I would heartily recommend &lt;strong&gt;open source&lt;/strong&gt; statistical software, based on your comfort with its specific &lt;em&gt;programming language&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;learning curve&lt;/em&gt; and your &lt;em&gt;career perspectives&lt;/em&gt;. My current platform of choice is &lt;strong&gt;R Project&lt;/strong&gt;, which offers mature, powerful, flexible, extensive and open statistical software, along with amazing ecosystem of packages, experts and enthusiasts. Other nice choices include &lt;em&gt;Python&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Julia&lt;/em&gt; and specific open source software for processing &lt;strong&gt;big data&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;em&gt;Hadoop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Spark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NoSQL&lt;/em&gt; databases, &lt;em&gt;WEKA&lt;/em&gt;.

Basically you need to estimate the respective class means and class covariances.  Now the first thing you care about is your estimate of the difference in the class means: but your performance is limited by the accuracy of the worst estimated mean: its no good estimating one mean to the 100th decimal place - if the other mean is only estimated to 1 decimal place.  So its a waste of computing resources to use all the data - you can instead undersample the  more common class AND reweight the classes appropriately. ( those computing resources can then be used exploring different input variables etc)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the second issue is predictive accuracy: different algorithms use different error metrics, which may or may not agree with your own objectives. eg logistic regression will penalise overall probability error,  so if  most of your data is from one class, then it will tend to try to improve accurate probability estimates ( eg 90 vs 95% probability) of that one class rather than trying to identify the rare class. in that case you would definitely want to try to reweight to emphasize the rare class ( and subsequently adjust the estimate [by adjusting the bias term] to get the probability estimates realigned)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1256" LastActivityDate="2014-08-23T14:15:58.660" CommentCount="0" />

One way to do this is to synthesize a string that is equidistant from all the non-outlier strings.  You can work out the required edit distance from the matrix, and then you'd randomly generate regular using those distances as constraints.  Then you'd test candidate regular expressions and accept the first one that fits the constraints and also accepts all the strings in your non-outlier list.

In other words, the tool that you use won't offer a &quot;silver bullet&quot;, because the output will only be as valuable as the input (you know the saying... &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;).

There are numerical issues with multiplying many small numbers(imagine if you had millions of samples you had to multiply millions of small numbers for the lhd). Also taking gradients for optimization methods that require gradients is often easier when you are dealing with the log likelihood. In general, it is good to have an objective which is a sum rather than a product of variables when dealing with optimization problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, fmin is using Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm which has no convergence guarantees according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin.html#scipy.optimize.fmin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;scipy documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This means the convergence is totally random and you should not expect to find parameters close to the originals. To get around this, I would suggest you to use a gradient based method like stochastic gradient descent or BFGS. Since you know the generative model (rvs are Gaussian distributed) you can write the likelihood and log likelihood as:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfsvr.png&quot; alt=&quot;equations&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where a,b,c and d are your model parameters 5,2,3 and 4 respectively.&#xA;Then take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gradient&lt;/a&gt; with respect to [a,b,c,d] and feed that into prime input of fmin_bfgs. Note that due to varying variance what could be solved by just linear regression is now a nastier problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you may also want to check Generalized least squares on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity&lt;/a&gt;, which talk about your problem and offer several available solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1350" LastActivityDate="2014-08-28T06:49:05.210" CommentCount="1" />

They probably retrieve the &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of the top 10000 documents for each word (10k integers - just a few kb!) and compute the best matches from that. Only if there aren't good matches in these lists, they expand to the next such blocks etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Queries for common words can be easily cached; and via preprocessing you can build a list of the top 10k results and then rerank them according to the user profile. There is nothing to be gained by computing an &quot;exact&quot; answer, too. Looking at the top 10k results is likely enough; there is no correct answer; and if a better result somewhere at position 10001 is missed, nobody will know or notice (or care).

And it's easy to get APRIORI wrong, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPgrowth is much harder to implement, but also much more interesting. So from an academic point of view, everybody tries to improve FPgrowth - getting work based on APRIORI accepted will be very hard by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a good implementation, every algorithm has it's good and it's bad situations in my opinion. A good APRIORI implementation will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; need to scan the database &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt; times to find all frequent itemsets of length &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;. In particular if your data fits into main memory this is cheap. What can kill APRIORI is too many frequent 2-itemsets (in particular when you don't use a Trie and similar acceleration techniques etc.). It works best on large data with a low number of frequent itemsets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eclat works on columns; but it needs to read each column much more often. There is some work on diffsets to reduce this work. If your data does not fit into main memory, Eclat suffers probably more than Apriori. By going depth first, it will also be able to return a first interesting result much earlier than Apriori, and you can use these results to adjust parameters; so you need less iterations to find good parameters. But by design, it cannot exploit pruning as neatly as Apriori did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPGrowth compresses the data set into the tree. This works best when you have lots of duplicate records. You could probably reap of quite some gains for Apriori and Eclat too if you can presort your data and merge duplicates into weighted vectors. FPGrowth does this at an extreme level. The drawback is that the implementation is much harder; and once this tree does not fit into memory anymore it gets a mess to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for performance results and benchmarks - don't trust them. There are so many things to implement incorrectly. Try 10 different implementations, and you get 10 very different performance results.

Classification (also known as categorization) is an example of &lt;strong&gt;supervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;. In supervised learning you have: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt; - something that approximates internal structure in your data, enabling you to reason about it and make useful predictions (e.g. predict class of an object); normally model has parameters that you want to &quot;learn&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;testing datasets&lt;/strong&gt; - sets of objects that you use for training your model (finding good values for parameters) and further evaluating &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;classification algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; - first describes how to learn model from training dataset, second shows how to derive class of a new object given trained model&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's take a simple case of spam classification. Your training dataset is a corpus of emails + corresponding labels - &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam&quot;. Testing dataset has the same structure, but made from some independent emails (normally one just splits his dataset and makes, say, 9/10 of it to be used for training and 1/10 - for testing). One way to model emails is to represent each of them as a set (bag) of words. If we assume that words are independent of each other, we can use &lt;strong&gt;Naive Bayes classifier&lt;/strong&gt;, that is, calculate prior probabilities for each word and each class (training algorithm) and then apply Bayes theorem to find posterior probability of a new document to belong to particular class. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, basically we have: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;raw model + training set + training algorithm -&amp;gt; trained model&#xA;trained model + classification algorithm + new object -&amp;gt; object label&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now note that we represented our objects (documents) as a bag of words. But is the only way? In fact, we can extract much more from raw text. For example, instead of words as is we can use their &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stems or lemmas&lt;/a&gt;, throw out noisy &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stop words&lt;/a&gt;, add &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;POS tags&lt;/a&gt; of words, extract &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;named entities&lt;/a&gt; or even explore HTML structure of the document. In fact, more general representation of a document (and, in general, any object) is a &lt;strong&gt;feature vector&lt;/strong&gt;. E.g. for text: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;actor, analogue, bad, burn, ..., NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ..., in_bold, ... | label&#xA;    0,        0,   1,    1, ...,    5,    7,   2, ...,       2, ... | not spam&#xA;    0,        1,   0,    0, ...,    3,   12,  10, ...,       0, ... | spam&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here first row is a list of possible features and subsequent rows show how many times that feature occurs in a document. E.g. in first document there's no occurrences of word &quot;actor&quot;, 1 occurrence of word &quot;burn&quot;, 5 nouns, 2 adjectives and 2 pieces of text in bold. Last column corresponds to a resulting class label. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using feature vector you can incorporate any properties of your texts. Though finding good set of features may take some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what about model and algorithms? Are we bound to Naive Bayes. Not at all. &lt;strong&gt;logistic regression&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SVM&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;decision trees&lt;/strong&gt; - just to mention few popular classifiers. (Note, that we say &quot;classifier&quot; in most cases we mean model + corresponding algorithms for training and classification). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for implementation, you can divide task into 2 parts: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Features extraction - transforming raw texts into feature vectors. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Object classification - building and applying model.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First point is well worked out in many &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4115526/natural-language-processing&quot;&gt;NLP libraries&lt;/a&gt;.

  <row Id="1105" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2014-09-12T11:06:48.203" Score="1" ViewCount="9" Body="&lt;p&gt;I am currently trying to implement logistic regression with iteratively reweightes LS, according to &quot;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&quot; by C. Bishop. In a first approach I tried to implement it in C#, where I used Gauss' algorithm to solve eq. 4.99. For a single feature it gave very promising (nearly exact) results, but whenever I tried to run it with more than one feature my system matrix became singular, and the weights did not converge. I first thought that it was my implementation, but when I implemented it in SciLab the results sustained. The SciLab (more concise due to matrix operators) code I used is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;phi = [1; 0; 1; 1];&#xA;t = [1; 0; 0; 0];&#xA;w= [1];&#xA;&#xA;w' * phi(1,:)'&#xA;&#xA;for in=1:100&#xA;    y = [];&#xA;    R = zeros(size(phi,1));&#xA;    R_inv = zeros(size(phi,1));&#xA;&#xA;    for i=1:size(phi,1)&#xA;        y(i) = 1/(1+ exp(-(w' * phi(i,:)')));&#xA;        R(i,i) = y(i)*(1 - y(i));&#xA;        R_inv(i,i) = 1/R(i,i);&#xA;    end&#xA;&#xA;    z = phi * w - R_inv*(y - t)&#xA;    w = inv(phi'*R*phi)*phi'*R*z&#xA;end&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the values for phi (input/features) and t (output/classes), it yields a weight of  -0.6931472, which is pretty much 1/3, which seems fine to me, for there is 1/3 probability of beeing assigned to class 1, if feature 1 is present (please forgive me, if my terms do not comply with ML-language completely, for I am an software developer). If I now added an intercept feature, which would accord to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;phi = [1, 1; 1, 0; 1, 1; 1, 1];&#xA;w = [1; 1];&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;my R-matrix becomes singular and the last weights value is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;w  =&#xA;  - 5.8151677  &#xA;  1.290D+30  &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which - to my reading - would mean, that the probability of belonging to class 1 would be close to 1 if feature 1 is present about 3% for the rest. There has got to be any error I made, but I do not get which one. For both implementations yield the same results I suspect that there is some point I've been missing or gotten wrong, but I do not understand which one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3283" LastActivityDate="2014-09-12T11:06:48.203" Title="Logistic Regression implementation does not converge" Tags="&lt;logistic-regression&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="2" />
